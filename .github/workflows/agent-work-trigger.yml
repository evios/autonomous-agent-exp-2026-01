name: Trigger Agent Work

# Chains agent sessions after PR merge + schedules weekly retro
# Only needed because claude-code-action doesn't support push events
#
# IMPORTANT: This workflow only triggers if the PR was merged using AGENT_PAT.
# GITHUB_TOKEN merges don't trigger push events (GitHub security feature).
# Without AGENT_PAT, the autonomous loop stops after the agent's PR is merged.
