name: Agent Self-Review

# NOTE: Agent cannot approve its own PR (GitHub limitation - same actor)
# The review serves as documentation. Auto-merge proceeds if branch protection allows.
# To require real approval, use a different token/bot for review.
#
# IMPORTANT: Without AGENT_PAT secret, the autonomous loop stops after merge.
# GITHUB_TOKEN merges don't trigger subsequent workflows (GitHub security feature).
# To enable full automation, add AGENT_PAT (fine-grained PAT with Contents + Pull requests permissions).

# Security: All actions pinned to commit SHAs to prevent tag hijacking attacks.
# Update SHAs manually when upgrading action versions.

          prompt: |
            Review this PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} created by your past self.

            Read:
            - GOALS.md for the current objectives
            - agent/config.md for safety limits
            - The PR diff: `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}`

            Check:
            1. Does the work align with goals in GOALS.md?
            2. Is the state file (agent/state/current.md) updated correctly?
            3. Are outputs meaningful and well-documented?
            4. Does the work follow the PDCA cycle?
            5. Are there any obvious errors or issues?
            6. Does it stay within boundaries?

            DECISION RULES:
            - If PR is acceptable (no critical issues) → MUST use --approve
            - If PR has critical issues that block merge → use --request-changes
            - NEVER use --comment for final review (it doesn't count as approval)

            CRITICAL: You MUST execute ONE of these commands:
            ```bash
            gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --approve --body "your summary"
            gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --request-changes --body "critical issues"
            ```

            Examples:
            - `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --approve --body "Good progress. State file updated, research documented."`
            - `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --request-changes --body "Missing state file update."`

            DEFAULT TO APPROVE unless there are critical blocking issues.
