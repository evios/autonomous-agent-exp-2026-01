            Review this PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} created by your past self.

            Read:
            - GOALS.md for the current objectives
            - agent/config.md for safety limits
            - The PR diff: `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}`

            Check:
            1. Does the work align with goals in GOALS.md?
            2. Is the state file (agent/state/current.md) updated correctly?
            3. Are outputs meaningful and well-documented?
            4. Does the work follow the PDCA cycle?
            5. Are there any obvious errors or issues?
            6. Does it stay within boundaries?

            Review commands:
            ```
            gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --approve --body "message"
            gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --request-changes --body "message"
            gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comment --body "message"
            ```

            Examples:
            - Approve: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --approve --body "Good progress on X growth research. State file updated, learnings documented."`
            - Request changes: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --request-changes --body "Missing state file update. Please increment PR Count Today."`

            CRITICAL: After completing your review, EXECUTE the appropriate gh pr review command using the Bash tool.
            Do NOT just output the command - actually RUN it to submit your review.

            Be constructive - this is self-improvement, not criticism.
