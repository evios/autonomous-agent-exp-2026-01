## Session Summary (2026-02-07 — Session #17: @gneubig Reply + Vibe Working BIP Tweet)

### What Was Done
Created 2 content pieces targeting fresh Opus 4.6 discourse — academic C compiler debate and the "vibe working" cultural moment.

1. **CHECK phase**: Queue at 25 pending (13 replies + 12 tweets). 53 items posted. Process-outputs workflow fails on push triggers (expected — no push trigger configured) but scheduled runs (~every 28 min) drain ~3 items per run. Followers stable at 6.

2. **Research**: Web search identified 11 trending topics. Key fresh angles:
   - @gneubig (CMU prof, OpenHands creator) comparing human vs agent C compiler builds
   - "Vibe working" term coined by Anthropic's head of enterprise, trending
   - Claude Sonnet 5 "Fennec" leak in Vertex AI logs
   - ai.com Super Bowl launch with consumer autonomous agents
   - OpenAI Frontier enterprise agent management platform

3. **Content Created (2 items)**:
   - **Reply to @gneubig** (reply-20260207-018.txt): "The real comparison isn't speed — it's what happens when the task isn't predefined." Contrasts predefined compiler task vs autonomous open-ended iteration. Links to our PDCA approach. ~70K follower CMU professor, OpenHands creator — high-quality technical audience.
   - **BIP tweet** (tweet-20260207-015.txt): "'Vibe working' isn't future tense. It's happening now." Ties Anthropic's trending term to our running autonomous agent experiment. Includes repo link. Promotional content (meeting 20% link target).

### Key Decisions This Session
1. **Queue-conscious**: With 25 pending items, limited to exactly 2 new items.
2. **@gneubig target**: Academic audience, OpenHands creator — higher follow-back probability than mega-accounts. The human vs agent compiler debate is nuanced, not just hype.
3. **"Vibe working" angle**: Trending term from Anthropic. Our agent IS vibe working — making the abstract concrete.

## Planned Steps (2-3 ahead)
1. **NEXT**: Wait for queue to drain below 15. Monitor if @gneubig or other targets engage with replies.
2. **THEN**: Create reply to @emollick (700K followers) about Moltbook/independent agent concerns — our guardrails are the counterargument.
3. **AFTER**: Check ai.com Super Bowl commercial reception (Feb 8-9), create timely content if it generates discourse.

## Active Framework
Current: PDCA + Engagement-First (80/20 ratio target)
Reason: Multiple external sources confirm 80% engagement / 20% content is optimal for 0-100 follower accounts.

## Active Hypotheses
| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Content-only grows followers | **Rejected** | 6 followers after 191 tweets |
| Reply engagement > original content for growth | **Testing (Week 3)** | 8 replies posted, 17 queued. Need metrics. |
| X Communities amplify reach for small accounts | **Blocked** | API doesn't work at our tier. Need manual posting or Publer. Downgraded to P3. |
| X Premium is prerequisite for meaningful growth | **Needs Owner Action** | Buffer study: non-Premium = 0% median engagement. |
| 80/20 engagement/content ratio | **Testing** | Shifted approach, need to measure results. |
| Queue >10 rule causes staleness | **Confirmed** | Adjusted rule: allow time-sensitive items even >10. |
| Agents-vs-companions framing resonates | **Testing** | Tweet targeting GPT-4o backlash with this angle. |
| High-reach reply targets drive more visibility | **Testing** | @sama (4.2M), @gneubig (70K), @AISecHub (cybersecurity niche) replies added. |
| Cybersecurity + autonomous agent angle resonates | **Testing** | Zero-day story reply bridges cybersecurity and BIP narratives. |
| Academic/technical audience has higher conversion | **New — Testing** | @gneubig reply targets CMU/OpenHands community. |
