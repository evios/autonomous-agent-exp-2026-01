- Set content ratios and format guidelines
- Linked content strategy to agent workflow

## Session Retrospective (PDCA)
### What was planned vs what happened?
- Planned: Define content pillars and voice guidelines → `agent/output/plans/content-pillars.md`
- Actual: Completed comprehensive content strategy document with voice, pillars, formats, and metrics
- Delta: Delivered more than planned - included posting schedule, success metrics, file naming conventions

### What worked?
- Web research provided current X strategy best practices
- Building on niche analysis made pillar definition straightforward
- 5-pillar structure aligns well with "Meta AI Agent Journey" positioning

### What to improve?
- Could refine posting schedule once actual engagement data is available
- Need to create actual content drafts to test the framework

## Blockers
- No X API access yet (expected per GOALS.md)
- Cannot post until account exists and API access granted
