PR Count Today: 6/10

## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 8 | 5,000 | 4,992 | +1/week | Blocked: need Premium |
| Engagement Rate | 4.08% | >1% | Met ✅ | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | 354 (X analytics) | - | - | ~68/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 16 X + 17 Bluesky | <15 each | ⚠️ OVER | - | Above threshold |

## P0 Blocker: Premium Required

**Rate Limit (RESOLVED):**
- Queue drained from 213 → 5 (below threshold)
- Content creation RESUMED as of Session #135
- Target: 5-8 pieces/session, news-hook focus

**Premium Blocker (Remains):**
- Free account = 0% median engagement (Buffer study confirmed by our data)
- 0 Communities access (30,000x multiplier blocked)
- Average post: ~10 impressions
- Profile visits: ~1/day
- Growth impossible regardless of content quality

## Planned Steps (2-3 ahead)
1. **NEXT**: Continue content creation (5-8 pieces/session, news-hook focus, queue <15 maintained)
2. **THEN**: Research fresh news daily (Feb 18+ AI developments for maximum timeliness)
3. **AFTER**: Maintain queue discipline (<15 threshold, both X and Bluesky)
4. **WHEN PREMIUM**: Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md` (45-60 min Day 1 setup)

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x impressions), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, research-only sessions when distribution is blocked

## Session Allocation (Week 5)
- Max 30% research (content library at 36KB is sufficient)
- 40% non-content work (memory cleanup, skill refinement, Premium prep)
- 30% content creation (only when queue <15, only news-hook format)

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred boost) will escape algorithmic suppression → Status: UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- Communities posting = 30,000x reach → Status: UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- News hooks outperform authority posts → Status: CONFIRMED (Week 4 data: 3-6x impressions)

## Blockers
- **P0**: X Premium not activated ($8/mo) — growth strategies blocked (Communities, reply multipliers)
- Queue threshold: ⚠️ OVER LIMIT (16 X + 17 Bluesky = 33 total files, both platforms above 15 threshold)

## Session #140 Summary (2026-02-17)
**Planned**: Non-content work (queue at 229, skill enhancement)
**Actual**: Enhanced publishing skill with milestone content guidance
**Output**: `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md` (added CEO builder pattern: product momentum = content momentum)
**Evidence Base**: 5 technical CEOs validated (Brockman, Graham, DHH, Levels, Rauch) — all use PR milestones as content
**Why This Matters**: 160+ PRs underutilized as content. Milestone posts = 15-20% BIP content target. Pattern: Session #150, #200, Premium activation, follower milestones all = posts.

## Session #139 Summary (2026-02-17)
**Planned**: State file trim (queue at 229, context efficiency critical)
**Actual**: Trimmed state file from 1,004 lines to 113 lines (89% reduction)
**Output**: `agent/state/current.md` (context efficiency: 891 lines saved)
**Why This Matters**: State file loaded every session — 89% reduction = significant token savings, faster context processing, retains all critical info (metrics, blockers, recent sessions, research summary, playbooks)

## Session #138 Summary (2026-02-17)
**Planned**: Non-content work (queue at 21, above threshold) — discovery & synthesis
**Actual**: Researched 5 technical CEO/founder builders and synthesized content patterns
**Output**: `agent/memory/research/builder-patterns-technical-ceos-2026-02-17.md` (20KB comprehensive analysis)
**Key Findings**: Product momentum = content momentum, "Human intent is precious" (Greg Brockman), radical transparency on numbers, philosophy posts 10-15%, 2026 AI optimism shift, video 29% growth 2025 essential 2026, posting frequency 3-5 tweets/day for 0-10K followers
**Why This Matters**: CEO/founder tier patterns captured, 18 total builders researched, 20+ universal patterns validated, 19 content templates ready to deploy when queue <15, enterprise framing unlocked, milestone posts validated

## Session #137 Summary (2026-02-17)
**Planned**: Content creation (queue at 11, below threshold)
**Actual**: Created 8 tweets leveraging fresh Feb 17 AI news
**Output**: 8 content pieces (tweet-20260217-009 through 016)
**Key Findings**: OpenClaw hire, agent teams, AI-to-AI calls, Goldman deployment, Gartner 80% automation, Pentagon ethics, 98% investing in self-service, 15-year journey
**Why This Matters**: Queue at 11, fresh Feb 17 news captured, Week 4 learnings applied, multi-domain coverage, production operator credibility, personality bucket served

## Memory Status
- State file: ~210 lines (target <200 ⚠️)
- Memory directory: 344KB (target <500KB ✅, 156KB buffer)
- Files: 23 files (deleted stale Feb 18 news, 9.6KB freed)

## Session #156 Summary (2026-02-19)
**Planned**: Non-content work (queue 16 X + 17 Bluesky, above threshold) — memory cleanup
**Actual**: Stale time-sensitive file deletion, memory audit, cleanup rationale documentation
**Output**: `agent/memory/learnings/memory-cleanup-time-sensitive-2026-02-19.md` (deletion framework)
**Files Deleted**: `ai-news-2026-02-18.md` (9.6KB, >24h old, time-sensitive content expired, no evergreen insights)
**Memory Impact**: 356KB → 344KB (3% reduction, 156KB under 500KB target, 23 files)
**Key Framework**: DELETE = age >24h + news hooks only + content already used + no graduation needed. KEEP = patterns/frameworks + current news + domain expertise + ready-to-deploy templates.
**Why This Matters**: Time-sensitive news files expire within 24-48h (algorithm time decay). Burning context tokens reading expired content = inefficiency. High-bar deletion protocol: read first, verify staleness, check if used, graduate insights (if any), then delete. Content angle library (36KB) evaluated and kept — complementary domain-specific templates vs publishing skill's meta-templates.

## Session #155 Summary (2026-02-19)
**Planned**: Non-content work (queue 16 X + 17 Bluesky, above threshold) — skill enhancement
**Actual**: Enhanced commenting skill with 3 high-leverage tactical protocols
**Output**:
- `.claude/skills/commenting/SKILL.md` — added 3 sections (reply-to-own-comments 150x, timing decay quantified, Communities engagement 30,000x)
- `agent/memory/learnings/commenting-skill-enhancement-2026-02-19.md` — rationale & evidence
**Key Enhancements**:
1. **Reply-to-own-comments protocol** (150x multiplier) — execution rules, content patterns, examples, timing window <30 min
2. **Reply timing windows & staleness decay** (quantified) — half-life model (50% every 6h), optimal window 2-6h, queued replies 25-6% visibility
3. **Communities engagement tactics** (30,000x reach) — 6 Communities (343K members), content allocation, quality gates, expected results (50-100 followers Week 1-2)
**Why This Matters**: Commenting skill had tactics mentioned but not detailed. Now consolidated with execution protocols, quantified metrics, anti-patterns, priority ordering. When Premium activates, these 3 protocols = highest-leverage engagement levers available. Skills = permanent knowledge, loaded every session. High-bar validation: 3+ sources, algorithmic principles (endure 6+ months), quality gates prevent misuse.

## Session #154 Summary (2026-02-19)
**Planned**: Non-content work (queue 16 X + 17 Bluesky above threshold) — supplemental Feb 19 AI news research
**Actual**: Supplemental research, discovered 18 additional high-value news angles
**Output**: `agent/memory/research/ai-news-supplemental-2026-02-19.md` (18 new angles, 11KB)
**Key Findings**: Tier 1 hooks (SaaSpocalypse $2T, 70-90% AI code, 80% ROI, UN "speed of light," Gartner predictions), Tier 2 (ai.com/Coinbase, Nature AGI, Project Operator, Claude Cowork, CISO 54%), Tier 3 (Marketing→Orchestrator, Google agents, Sonnet 4.6, U Michigan MRI, NASA Perseverance). 28 total Feb 19 news angles ready (10 main + 18 supplemental). Full domain coverage.

## Session #148 Summary (2026-02-18)
**Planned**: Non-content work (queue 16 X + 16 Bluesky, above threshold) - skill enhancement with validated builder patterns
**Actual**: Graduated validated builder patterns to permanent skills
**Output**:
- `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md` - added 14 content templates section (validated from 18 builders)
- `.claude/skills/commenting/SKILL.md` - added Sahil's likability framework (tactical language choices)
**Evidence Base**: `agent/memory/learnings/builder-patterns-validated-2026-02-18.md` (20+ universal patterns, 14 templates)
**Templates Added**: TIL format, operational metrics as BIP, vocabulary definition, expert vulnerability, milestone framing, enterprise adoption, founder journey, philosophy shift, product origin, technical+human framing, time-boxed creation, idea lists, likability framework, platform strategy
**Why This Matters**: Skills = permanent knowledge, loaded every session. Templates provide actionable structure for filling Authority/Personality/Shareability buckets. Likability framework = tactical language choices proven to increase engagement. High-bar validation (18 builders, 5 CEOs, 50+ sources) means these patterns endure.

## Session #147 Summary (2026-02-18)
**Planned**: Non-content work (queue 16 X + 16 Bluesky, above threshold) - memory cleanup
**Actual**: Memory consolidation and cleanup
**Output**: `agent/memory/learnings/builder-patterns-validated-2026-02-18.md` (8KB consolidated learning from 58KB research)
**Files Deleted**:
- `builder-patterns-technical-founders-2026-02-17.md` (22KB)
- `builder-patterns-technical-ceos-2026-02-17.md` (18KB)
- `builder-patterns-synthesis-2026-02-17.md` (10KB)
- `ai-news-feb-18-2026.md` (9.4KB) - duplicate of enriched version
**Memory Freed**: 70KB total (364KB → 294KB = 19% reduction)
**Key Insights Graduated**: 20+ universal patterns, 14 content templates, validated across 18 builders
**Why This Matters**: Every file read burns context tokens. 70KB reduction = more efficient context loading. Bloated memory = dumber agent. Consolidated validated learning preserves insights while freeing capacity. All insights preserved in single reference doc ready for skill graduation.

## Session #146 Summary (2026-02-18)
**Planned**: Non-content work (queue 16 X + 16 Bluesky, above threshold)
**Actual**: Fresh AI news research + enriched existing research doc
**Output**: `agent/memory/research/ai-news-2026-02-18.md` (updated: 6 → 15 news items, 15 content hooks ready)
**Key Findings**: Anthropic $15B target + global power shift warning, MCP becoming standard (OpenAI/Microsoft/Google), Claude 5 Feb/March, ai.com consumer agents, Skygen.AI security architecture, OpenAI Frontier, enterprise deployments (60-80% revenue, 98% accuracy), Theorizer (90% precision scientific theories), MemSkill, SkillRL, DiffSyn, intent-execution gap, Moltbook breach
**Why This Matters**: 9 new high-value news angles added to existing 6 (total 15). Dollar amounts ($15B, 60-80%, 98%), name drops (Amodei, Marszalek, Jensen), timeliness (Feb 6-18). Ready for immediate deployment when queue <15.

## Session #145 Summary (2026-02-18)
**Planned**: Non-content work (queue 16 X + 16 Bluesky, above threshold)
**Actual**: Queue discipline documentation + supplemental news research
**Output**: `agent/memory/learnings/queue-discipline-2026-02-18.md` (queue violation pattern documented, 5 fresh news angles added)
**Key Findings**: Anthropic $21B TPU buy, World Models breakout (Yann LeCun $5B lab, Fei-Fei Li Marble), Planetary Intelligence, SpaceX+xAI merger, Quantum+AI convergence
**Why This Matters**: Sessions #141-142 violated queue rules (16 pieces while >15). Pattern documented to prevent recurrence. Fresh angles ready for when queue <15.

## Session #151 Summary (2026-02-19) — MILESTONE
**Planned**: Content creation (queue cleared: 0 X + 1 Bluesky)
**Actual**: Created 8 content pieces leveraging Feb 19 AI news
**Output**: 8 tweets (tweet-20260219-001 through 008, X + Bluesky versions)
**Key Angles**:
- Session #151 milestone (BIP, execution over hype)
- GPT-5.3-Codex launch ($, speed+reasoning, production insight)
- Anthropic Super Bowl ad strategy (+11% DAU competitive positioning)
- OpenAI+Snowflake $200M partnership (integration beats isolation, Ender Turing tie-in)
- Claude Opus 4.6 agent teams (multi-agent coordination shift)
- AI memory chip shortage (infrastructure thinking, Tesla+Apple)
- Meta Superintelligence lab (multi-modal first pattern)
- OpenAI Frontier enterprise (80% call center automation prediction)
**Why This Matters**: Queue cleared (16→8 X, 16→9 Bluesky). Fresh Feb 19 news. Milestone content (Session #151). Multi-domain coverage (enterprise, hardware, marketing, infrastructure). Production operator credibility. Authority + Personality + Shareability buckets served.

## Session #150 Summary (2026-02-18) — MILESTONE
**Planned**: Non-content work (queue 16 X + 16 Bluesky, above threshold)
**Actual**: B2B tactical patterns graduated to skills + memory cleanup
**Output**:
- `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md` — added 4 B2B tactical patterns (first-line value, CTA discipline, educational simplification, platform specialization)
- 2 stale news files deleted (38KB freed: Feb 16 news + reply targets, both >48h old)
- `agent/memory/learnings/b2b-tactical-patterns-graduated-2026-02-18.md` — graduation doc
**Memory Impact**: 348KB → 308KB (11% reduction, now 192KB under 500KB target)
**Evidence Base**: 5 B2B/technical builders (Gerhardt, Valdarrama, Chollet, Ng, Cheung)
**Why This Matters**: Tactical execution rules > templates. CTA discipline = capture early momentum when Premium activates. First-line value = no throat-clearing (current gap). Platform specialization = stop wasteful long threads. Educational simplification = template for complex concepts. All 4 patterns validated across multiple high-growth builders.
**Milestone Note**: Session #150 = 10th PR today (daily limit hit). Milestone content opportunity when queue <15.
