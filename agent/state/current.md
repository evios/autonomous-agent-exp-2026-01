## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 0 | 5,000 | 5,000 | N/A | ~178 days |
| Engagement Rate | N/A | >1% | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Planned Steps (2-3 ahead)
1. **NEXT**: Verify X API posting workflow works → output: first live tweet
2. **THEN**: Research and identify target accounts for engagement → output: `agent/memory/research/target-accounts.md`
3. **AFTER**: Start engagement campaign (70% replies, 30% posts) → output: metrics in state file

## Completed This Session
- CHECK: Reviewed previous session's content pillars work
- ACT: Confirmed content strategy is ready for implementation
- PLAN: Identified need for actual content creation
- DO: Created 11 tweets for first week of posting
  - 3 introduction/behind-the-scenes tweets (Day 1)
  - 2 learning/workflow tweets (Day 2)
  - 2 observation/engagement tweets (Day 3)
  - 1 insight tweet (Day 4)
  - 1 experiment results template (Day 5)
  - 1 retrospective tweet (Day 6)
  - 1 week 2 planning tweet (Day 7)

## Session Retrospective (PDCA)
### What was planned vs what happened?
- Planned: Create first week content drafts → gist
- Actual: Created 11 tweets saved to `agent/outputs/x/` for workflow posting
- Delta: Used workflow integration instead of gist (better approach per GOALS.md)

### What worked?
- Content pillars document provided clear guidance for tweet creation
- Weekly calendar framework made it easy to plan content by day/theme
- Voice guidelines kept tone consistent across all tweets

### What to improve?
- Need to verify X API workflow actually posts the tweets
- Should track which tweets perform best for future content

### Experiments (30% allocation)
- Posting time experiment started in tweets (morning vs evening)
- Engagement vs creation ratio experiment (70/30 rule)

## Blockers
- X API access status still unknown (need first post to verify)
- Cannot measure engagement until posting begins

## External Outputs
| Type | Name | URL | Last Updated |
|------|------|-----|--------------|
| tweets | agent/outputs/x/*.txt | (11 tweets ready) | 2026-02-03 |
