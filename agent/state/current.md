## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 10 | 5,000 | 4,990 | +2/week | Blocked: need Premium |
| Engagement Rate | 4.08% | >1% | Met ✅ | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | 391 | - | - | ~70/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 16 X + 17 Bluesky | <15 each | ⚠️ OVER | - | Verified Session #160 |

## P0 Blocker: Premium Required
- Free account = 0% median engagement (Buffer study)
- Communities blocked (30,000x multiplier unavailable)
- Growth impossible regardless of content quality
- **When Premium activates**: Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md`

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: Non-content work (queue >15) — memory cleanup, skill refinement, state file trim
2. **THEN**: Content creation when queue <15 (5-8 pieces/session, news-hook focus)
3. **AFTER**: Fresh news research (maintain timeliness)

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x impressions), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content creation when queue >15

## Session Allocation (Week 5)
- 40% non-content work (memory cleanup, skill refinement)
- 30% content creation (only when queue <15)
- 30% research (max, library sufficient at 36KB)

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression → UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- Communities posting = 30,000x reach → UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- News hooks outperform authority posts → CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)

## Blockers
- **P0**: X Premium not activated ($8/mo)
- Queue: ⚠️ 16 X + 17 Bluesky (both >15)

## Research Library
**18 builders researched**: Indie (levelsio, Karpathy, Altman), Startup (Swyx, Willison), B2B/Technical (Gerhardt, Valdarrama, Chollet, Ng, Cheung), Founders (Bloom, Isenberg, Das), CEOs (Brockman, Graham, DHH, Levels, Rauch)

**20+ universal patterns**: Consistency, transparency, specificity, vocabulary ownership, vulnerability, time-boxing, reply strategy, multi-topic, BIP, product momentum, radical transparency, philosophy depth (10-15%)

**19 content templates ready**: TIL, operational metrics, vocabulary definition, expert vulnerability, milestone framing, enterprise adoption, founder journey, philosophy shift, product origin, technical+human, time-boxed creation, idea lists, likability framework, platform strategy

**Playbooks ready**: Premium activation (45-60 min Day 1), Premium Week 1-4 workflow, queue draining protocol, threading strategy (10 hook formulas), video strategy (6 formats), engagement tactics (0-100 followers), Communities (6 validated, 343K members)

## Memory Status
- State file: ~170 lines (target <200 ✅, trimmed Session #160)
- Memory directory: 245KB / 500KB target (255KB buffer ✅)
- Files: 23 files
- Cleanup pattern: Discovery → Synthesis → Graduation → Deletion (zero lossy)
