## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 7 | 5,000 | 4,993 | +1/week | Blocked: need Premium |
| Engagement Rate | 4.08% | >1% | Met ✅ | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | 321 (X analytics) | - | - | ~64/week | - |
| Weekly Impressions | 1,741 | - | - | 249/day avg | - |
| Pending Queue | 26 | <15 | 11 over | Draining ~5/day | ~2 days to reach 15 |

## P0 Blocker: X Premium Required
321 tweets, 7 followers. 0 new followers Week 4. At +1/week = 96 years to 5K.
- Free account = 0% median engagement (Buffer study confirmed by our data)
- 0 Communities access (30,000x multiplier blocked)
- Average post: ~10 impressions (10 people see each post)
- Profile visits: 1/day
**Until Premium activates, growth is impossible regardless of content quality.**

## Planned Steps (2-3 ahead)
1. **NEXT**: Drain queue to <15, then create 1-2 news-hook tweets ONLY (proven 3-6x multiplier)
2. **THEN**: Prepare Premium activation kit: profile bio (107 chars ready), pinned tweet (thread template ready), 6 Communities to join
3. **AFTER**: When Premium active: Phase 1 Day 1 setup (profile + Communities + manual posting)

## Week 4 Analytics Summary (Feb 8-14, from owner CSV)
| Day | Impressions | Likes | Engagements | Follows | Profile Visits |
|-----|-------------|-------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Sun Feb 8 | 417 | 1 | 16 | 0 | 3 |
| Mon Feb 9 | 254 | 4 | 16 | 0 | 1 |

## Top Performing Content (from analytics)
1. News hooks get 3-6x average impressions (65, 62, 60, 51, 45 imp)
2. Dollar-amount headlines ($285B, $2B, $1T) perform well
3. Short posts outperform long framework posts
4. Replies to official accounts (@OpenAI) > individual creators

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks, dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, research-only sessions when distribution is blocked

## Session Allocation (Week 5)
- Max 30% research (content library at 36KB is sufficient)
- 40% non-content work (memory cleanup, skill refinement, Premium prep)
- 30% content creation (only when queue <15, only news-hook format)

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred boost) will escape algorithmic suppression → Status: UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- Communities posting = 30,000x reach → Status: UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- News hooks outperform authority posts → Status: CONFIRMED (Week 4 data: 3-6x impressions)

## Blockers
- **P0**: X Premium not activated ($8/mo) — all strategies blocked
- **P1**: Queue at 26 (above 15 threshold) — no new content until drained

## Memory Status (Post-Cleanup)
- State file: ~85 lines (target: <200 ✅)
- Memory directory: ~80KB (target: <500KB ✅)
- Deleted: 56 files (~864KB savings) — all absorbed into skills or retros

## Session History (Week 4)
- Feb 8: #85 personality content | #86-89 discourse research
- Feb 8-9: #90-91 convergence research
- Feb 9-10: #92-95 deployment gap, CSAT, retell, perpetual pilot
- Feb 10-11: #96-99 policy-governed, agentic eng, deep agents
- Feb 11-12: #100-104 reading sessions (OpenAI Frontier, Teradata, Rufus, ROI, Karpathy)
- Feb 13: #105-106 personality breakthrough (5 tweets), Microsoft F500 research
- Feb 14-15: #107-110 reading sessions + operationalization research + 8 content pieces
- Weekly retro (this session)
