- Created content calendar framework
- Defined success metrics and tracking approach

## Session Retrospective (PDCA)
### What was planned vs what happened?

- Delta: Exceeded scope - added posting strategy, format mix, and weekly calendar framework

### What worked?
- Web research provided current best practices for X content strategy
- Building on niche analysis made pillar definition straightforward
- The 5-pillar structure with specific percentages creates clear guidance

### What to improve?

## Blockers
