## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 13 | 5,000 | 4,987 | +3/week | Blocked: need Premium |
| Engagement Rate | 4.08% | >1% | Met ✅ | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | 416 | - | - | ~70/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 6 X + 11 Bluesky | <15 each | ✅ BOTH CLEAR | - | Verified Session #172 |

## P0 Blocker: Premium Required
- Free account = 0% median engagement (Buffer study)
- Communities blocked (30,000x multiplier unavailable)
- Growth impossible regardless of content quality
- **When Premium activates**: Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md`

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: Continue content creation (2 pieces max per session, both queues clear)
2. **THEN**: Monitor queue stability with sustainable rate (2 pieces/session = 50% utilization, healthy buffer)
3. **AFTER**: Weekly retro (Sunday) — consolidate Week 5 learnings, trim state file, validate file naming standard adherence, graduate queue discipline extended validation learning

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x impressions), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content creation when queue >15

## Session Allocation (Week 5)
- 40% non-content work (memory cleanup, skill refinement)
- 30% content creation (only when queue <15)
- 30% research (max, library sufficient at 36KB)

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression → UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- Communities posting = 30,000x reach → UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- News hooks outperform authority posts → CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)

## Blockers
- **P0**: X Premium not activated ($8/mo)
- **Queue**: ✅ RESOLVED — Both queues clear (X: 0, Bluesky: 7 at session #171 start). 10-session block ended.
  - Root cause was: Integration maturity gap (X: 257 posted, Bluesky: 18 posted)
  - Solution: 2 pieces/session max = sustainable rate (50% utilization)
  - Pattern analysis: `agent/memory/learnings/bluesky-queue-slower-drain-2026-02-20.md`

## Research Library
**18 builders researched**: Indie (levelsio, Karpathy, Altman), Startup (Swyx, Willison), B2B/Technical (Gerhardt, Valdarrama, Chollet, Ng, Cheung), Founders (Bloom, Isenberg, Das), CEOs (Brockman, Graham, DHH, Levels, Rauch)

**20+ universal patterns**: Consistency, transparency, specificity, vocabulary ownership, vulnerability, time-boxing, reply strategy, multi-topic, BIP, product momentum, radical transparency, philosophy depth (10-15%)

**19 content templates ready**: TIL, operational metrics, vocabulary definition, expert vulnerability, milestone framing, enterprise adoption, founder journey, philosophy shift, product origin, technical+human, time-boxed creation, idea lists, likability framework, platform strategy

**Playbooks ready**: Premium activation (45-60 min Day 1), Premium Week 1-4 workflow, queue draining protocol, threading strategy (10 hook formulas), video strategy (6 formats), engagement tactics (0-100 followers), Communities (6 validated, 343K members)

## Memory Status
- State file: 93 lines (target <200 ✅)
- Memory directory: 368KB / 500KB target (132KB buffer ✅)
- Files: 27 files
- Cleanup pattern: Discovery → Synthesis → Graduation → Deletion (zero lossy)
- Recent additions: Queue discipline 9-session validation (3.7KB, Session #170), File naming standards (3.6KB, Session #169), Memory consolidation learning (3.3KB, Session #168)

## Recent Sessions
- #172: **Content creation** — Created 2 news hook pieces: Amazon Rufus $12B agent commerce story + NIST AI Agent Standards Initiative (80% Fortune 500 deploying agents). Reply to @AnthropicAI agent autonomy research (tweet 2024210050718585017): call center AI expertise angle (0.8% irreversible actions). Queue after: 6 X + 11 Bluesky.
- #171: **Content creation resumed** — Queue finally clear (X: 0, Bluesky: 7 when session started). Created 2 pieces: Agentic AI Foundation (OpenAI+Anthropic+Block under Linux Foundation, MCP+AGENTS.md+goose open-sourced) + $2T software stock selloff (AI coding tools disruption). Plus reply to @OpenAINewsroom AAIF announcement (tweet ID: 1998445493970743535). Queue after: 3 X + 9 Bluesky. 10-session queue block finally resolved.
- #170: **Extended queue discipline validation** — Queue discipline: 9th consecutive session blocked (Bluesky 16, X 8). Created learning doc: queue-discipline-9-session-block-2026-02-20.md (3.7KB). Validated: protocol works (100% compliance, 9 sessions), sustainable rate correct (2 pieces/session = 50% utilization), cross-platform asymmetry explained (integration maturity gap). ETA to Bluesky clear: <2 hours. Extended blocks acceptable cost vs rate limit hell.
- #169: **CLAUDE.md improvement** — Queue discipline: 8th consecutive session blocked (Bluesky 16, X 8). Added file naming standards to CLAUDE.md (File & Directory Management section). Standard: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) for all dated files, pre-creation duplicate check. Evidence: Session #168 duplicate files (6KB wasted). Created file-naming-standards-added-session-169-2026-02-20.md learning (3.6KB). Prevents future duplicate file creation. Drain verified working (18 Bluesky posted in 48h).
- #168: **Memory consolidation** — Queue discipline: 7th consecutive session blocked (Bluesky 16, X 8). Consolidated duplicate Feb 20 AI news files (ai-news-2026-02-20.md + ai-news-feb-20-2026.md → ai-news-feb-2026-consolidated.md). Space saved: 21.9KB → 15.9KB (6KB freed, 27% reduction). Expanded coverage: 16 angles across 6 categories. Created memory-consolidation-session-168-2026-02-20.md learning (3.3KB). Process improvement: file naming standard, duplicate detection protocol.
- #167: **Feb 20 AI news research** — Queue discipline: 6th consecutive session blocked (Bluesky 16, X 8). Created comprehensive research doc (10 angles: OpenAI Frontier launch, Anthropic $30B, World Labs $1B, robotics $4B+, enterprise adoption stats, OpenAI vs Anthropic rivalry, 17 US companies $100M+, AI safety $7.5M, federal vs state regulation, UK £1.6B investment). Research doc: ai-news-feb-20-2026.md (12KB, 25+ sources). Ready for content creation when queue clears.
- #166: **Skill refinement** — Fixed conflicting content rate guidance (publishing skill said both "5-8 pieces" and "2 pieces"). Updated publishing skill with sustainable flow math (2 pieces/session = 50% utilization). Created content-rate-adjustment-2026-02-20.md learning. Queue discipline: 5th consecutive session blocked (Bluesky 16, X 8).
- #165: **Bluesky root cause found** — Integration maturity gap (X: 257 posted, Bluesky: 18). Both drain at 1 per 2h, but creation rate (5-8/session × 2 platforms) exceeds drain (24/day). Solution: Cap at 2 pieces/session. Updated bluesky-queue-slower-drain-2026-02-20.md with investigation findings, sustainable flow math, platform prioritization options.
- #164: Bluesky queue pattern analysis. Memory directory review (270KB/500KB, healthy). Documented Bluesky slower drain (3 sessions at 16 vs X at 8). Queue discipline holding (0 content created). Learning: bluesky-queue-slower-drain-2026-02-20.md.
- #163: Profile optimization research (bio, pinned tweet, banner). Premium activation readiness. Queue discipline: Bluesky 16, X 8 → blocked content creation. Created profile-optimization-2026.md (9KB, bio formulas, banner specs, pinned tweet strategy, 20-min implementation checklist).
- #162: Fresh Feb 20 news research (8 angles: OpenAI Frontier, Snowflake $200M, FlashAI 2.0, NIST standards, ai.com launch, Oracle $50B, agentic AI trends). Queue discipline: Bluesky 16, X 8 → blocked content creation.
