## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 7 | 5,000 | 4,993 | +1/week | Blocked: need Premium |
| Engagement Rate | 4.08% | >1% | Met ✅ | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | 321 (X analytics) | - | - | ~64/week | - |
| Weekly Impressions | 1,741 | - | - | 249/day avg | - |
| Pending Queue | 23 | <15 | 8 over | Draining ~5/day | ~2 days to reach 15 |

## P0 Blocker: X Premium Required
321 tweets, 7 followers. 0 new followers Week 4. At +1/week = 96 years to 5K.
- Free account = 0% median engagement (Buffer study confirmed by our data)
- 0 Communities access (30,000x multiplier blocked)
- Average post: ~10 impressions (10 people see each post)
- Profile visits: 1/day
**Until Premium activates, growth is impossible regardless of content quality.**

## Planned Steps (2-3 ahead)
1. **NEXT**: Queue drainage continues (30 → target <15) — no content creation until threshold met
2. **THEN**: When Premium activates: Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md` (45-60 min Day 1 setup)
3. **AFTER**: Week 1-2 validation: manual Communities posting, track follower growth, measure 10x hypothesis

## Week 4 Analytics Summary (Feb 8-14, from owner CSV)

## Top Performing Content (from analytics)
1. News hooks get 3-6x average impressions (65, 62, 60, 51, 45 imp)
2. Dollar-amount headlines ($285B, $2B, $1T) perform well
3. Short posts outperform long framework posts
4. Replies to official accounts (@OpenAI) > individual creators

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks, dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, research-only sessions when distribution is blocked

## Session Allocation (Week 5)
- Max 30% research (content library at 36KB is sufficient)
- 40% non-content work (memory cleanup, skill refinement, Premium prep)
- 30% content creation (only when queue <15, only news-hook format)

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred boost) will escape algorithmic suppression → Status: UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- Communities posting = 30,000x reach → Status: UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- News hooks outperform authority posts → Status: CONFIRMED (Week 4 data: 3-6x impressions)

## Blockers
- **P0**: X Premium not activated ($8/mo) — all strategies blocked
- **P1**: Queue at 23 (above 15 threshold) — no new content until drained

## Session #113 Summary (2026-02-15)
**Planned**: Non-content work (queue at 23, above threshold)
**Actual**: Commenting skill streamlining (context optimization continues)
**Output**: `.claude/skills/commenting/SKILL.md` (42% size reduction)

**What Changed**:
- Reduced from 391 lines / ~15KB → 225 lines / 8KB (42% reduction)
- Removed detailed reply templates (5 full examples → condensed principles)
- Removed Twitter Lists setup detail (that's a plan, not a skill)
- Removed duplicate algorithm info (already in publishing skill)
- Removed speculative 90-day timeline benchmarks
- Kept: Core principles, target selection rules, value test, quality checklist, queue-delayed reality

**Why This Matters**:
- Commenting skill loaded every session → 7KB savings = better context efficiency
- Skills should be decision frameworks, not implementation playbooks
- Total skill optimization across #112-113: 48KB savings (publishing 41KB + commenting 7KB)
- Remaining candidates: discovery (350 lines), integrations (72 lines)

**Session Allocation**: 100% non-content work (skill refinement) — followed queue discipline

## Session #112 Summary (2026-02-15)
**Planned**: Non-content work (queue at 27, above threshold)
**Actual**: Publishing skill streamlining (critical context optimization)
**Output**: `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md` (78% size reduction)

**What Changed**:
- Reduced from 1,160 lines / 52KB → 296 lines / 11KB (78% reduction)
- Removed duplication: Premium activation, profile optimization, Communities setup (now live in playbook)
- Removed excessive detail: 8 hook formulas → condensed list, personality/shareability patterns → removed
- Removed technical deep-dives: Algorithm mechanics (TweepCred thresholds, time decay) → condensed to key principles
- Kept: Core strategy frameworks, decision rules, tactical execution, content checklist, evidence references

**Why This Matters**:
- Bloated skills consume context budget → dumber agent
- Skills should be principles, not playbooks (playbooks live in outputs/)
- Every session loads this skill → 41KB savings = significant token efficiency
- Follow-up: Next retro should audit other skills (commenting, discovery, integrations)

**Session Allocation**: 100% non-content work (skill refinement) — followed queue discipline

## Session #111 Summary (2026-02-15)
**Output**: `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md` (comprehensive 45-60 min setup guide)
**Session Allocation**: 100% non-content work (Premium prep)

## Memory Status (Post-Cleanup)
- State file: ~85 lines (target: <200 ✅)
- Memory directory: ~80KB (target: <500KB ✅)
- Deleted: 56 files (~864KB savings) — all absorbed into skills or retros

## Session History (Week 4-5)
- Feb 8: #85 personality content | #86-89 discourse research
- Feb 8-9: #90-91 convergence research
- Feb 9-10: #92-95 deployment gap, CSAT, retell, perpetual pilot
- Feb 10-11: #96-99 policy-governed, agentic eng, deep agents
- Feb 11-12: #100-104 reading sessions (OpenAI Frontier, Teradata, Rufus, ROI, Karpathy)
- Feb 13: #105-106 personality breakthrough (5 tweets), Microsoft F500 research
- Feb 14-15: #107-110 reading sessions + operationalization research + 8 content pieces
- Feb 15: Weekly retro + #111 Premium Activation Playbook (45-60 min Day 1 checklist ready)
