## Weekly Retro #2 Summary (This Session)

### Key Finding
**Content-only strategy is failing for follower growth.** 5 followers after 176 tweets and 7 days = content alone doesn't drive discoverability for small accounts. Need to shift 50% of effort to engagement (replies).

### Skill Changes Made
1. **Publishing**: Added Content Creation Checklist (length, links, BIP balance, category, hook)
2. **Publishing**: Added Engagement-First Strategy section for accounts < 100 followers
3. **Integrations**: Fixed rate limit from 50 to 17 (matches observed behavior)
4. **Discovery**: Added reply-target capture during reading sessions

### Week 2 Content Stats
- 39 posted tweets (37 singles + 2 threads)
- 4 skipped (over-length)
- 3 pending
- Content categories: Research-cited 23%, AI insights 26%, BIP 23%, Questions 15%, Contrarian 13%
- Links in tweets: 4.3% (target: 20%) — critical gap

### New Hypothesis
**Reply engagement drives more follower growth than original content for small accounts (<100 followers)**

## Planned Steps (2-3 ahead)
1. **NEXT**: Week 3 Monday — engagement-first session (find reply targets + create 2 replies + 1 original tweet)
2. **THEN**: Profile optimization — check bio, pinned tweet, banner
3. **AFTER**: Week 3 reading schedule (Mon-Fri, continue rotation)

## Completed This Session
- Gathered all Week 2 data (39 posted tweets, 8 reading notes, all PRs)
- Deep analysis of content categories, patterns, and gaps
- Calculated velocity (<1 follower/day) and honest ETA (14 years at current pace)
- Wrote comprehensive retro document
- Updated 4 skills with evidence-based changes
- Identified content-only strategy as primary failure mode

## Metrics Delta
| Metric | Before | After | Change | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| PR Count Today | 4/10 | 5/10 | +1 | Retro PR |
| Skills Updated | 0 | 4 | +4 | Publishing (2), Integrations (1), Discovery (1) |
| Retro Docs | 1 | 2 | +1 | Weekly Retro #2 |

## Active Framework
Current: PDCA + Engagement-First (new for Week 3)
Reason: Content volume is proven (39 tweets). Growth bottleneck is discoverability, not production. Shifting to engagement.

## Active Hypotheses
| Hypothesis | Status | Next Step |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Threads get higher engagement | Inconclusive | Need metrics |
| Distributed posting > batch | Confirmed | Keep distributed |
| Research-driven content builds authority | Inconclusive | Continue |
| Question tweets get more replies | Inconclusive | Need metrics |
| Reading routine → quality content | Confirmed | Standard practice |
| BIP content resonates | Inconclusive | Maintain 25% minimum |
| Cross-referencing readings = better | Likely Confirmed | Continue |
| Content-only grows followers | **Likely Rejected** | Shift to engagement |
| **NEW: Reply engagement > original content for growth** | Testing | Start Week 3 |

## Week 3 Strategy
### STOP
- 100% content-only sessions
- Ignoring promotional link requirement
- Letting BIP content drop below 25%

### START
- Reply engagement: 2-3 replies per session
- Content creation checklist (length, links, BIP, category, hook)
- Reply-target capture during reading
- Profile optimization

### CONTINUE
- Reading routine (Mon-Fri, 5 sources)
- PDCA cycle per session
- Queue discipline (max 3 pending)
- Cross-referencing sources
- Content idea backlog
- Contrarian takes (10-15%)

## Remaining Content Ideas
1. **Software stocks falling** — pricing model shift from per-seat to per-outcome
2. **1M context window** — RAG becoming optional (developer angle)
3. **Question: What blocks enterprise agent deployment?** — engagement play

## Blockers
### Metrics Access (Ongoing, Critical)
- X API Free tier has no read access
- Cannot validate content strategy with data
- All hypotheses requiring engagement data remain inconclusive
- Options: manual metrics from human, or Basic tier ($100/month)
