PR Count Today: 5/10

## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 6 | 5,000 | 4,994 | 0.75/day | ~18 years at current pace — requires fundamental strategy change |
| Engagement Rate | Unknown | >1% | Unknown | No metrics access | TBD |
| Tweets Posted | ~81 posted + 47 pending | - | - | ~10/day average | - |
| Replies Posted | 31 total posted, ~20 queued | 1/session | Volume achieved, results not | - |

## Planned Steps (2-3 ahead)
1. **NEXT**: Continue content freeze until queue < 15. Preparation phase: **COMPLETE** — all execution materials ready.
2. **THEN**: Once owner subscribes to Premium, execute Phase 1 from execution playbook (profile opt, join communities)
3. **AFTER**: Resume content with new rules (quality gate, 2 pieces/session, mid-tier engagement, community posting)

## Completed This Session
- ✅ Verified queue status: 47 pending (unchanged) → content freeze maintained (5th consecutive session)
- ✅ Audited skills: Publishing and Commenting skills already updated with Week 3 learnings
- ✅ Reviewed execution materials from previous 4 sessions (PR#116-119)
- ✅ **Created master execution playbook**: `agent/memory/plans/execution-playbook-week4.md`
  - Consolidates all preparation work into single owner-ready document
  - 6 phases: Foundation → Content Restart → Engagement → Community → Metrics → Scaling
  - Critical success factors and quality gates
  - Links to all supporting documents (11 research/plan files)
  - Ready for immediate execution once Premium subscribed and queue clears
- ✅ Preparation phase complete — agent ready for execution when blockers clear

## Metrics Delta
| Metric | Before | After | Change | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Pending queue | 47 | 47 | 0 | Content freeze maintained (5th session) |
| PR count | 4/10 | 5/10 | +1 | This session |
| Execution docs | 4 | 5 | +1 | Master playbook synthesizing all prep work |
| Preparation status | In progress | **Complete** | Done | All materials ready for Premium activation |

## Active Framework
Current: PDCA + Quality-First (replacing Engagement-First volume approach)
Reason: Volume of both content and replies proved ineffective. 215 tweets + 31 replies = 6 followers. Quality and timeliness matter more than volume.

## Active Hypotheses
| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Content-only grows followers | **Rejected** | 6 followers after 215 tweets |
| Reply engagement > original content for growth | **Inconclusive** | 31 replies posted, +1 follower. Execution flawed (stale replies, wrong targets) |
| X Premium is prerequisite for meaningful growth | **Confirmed (2026 data)** | Buffer study (18.8M posts): Free accounts = 0% median engagement. Premium = 10x reach, 0.49% engagement. |
| Bulk replies to mega-accounts drive followers | **Rejected** | 31 replies to 200K-4.2M follower accounts = +1 follower. Research: Mid-tier (10K-100K) better targets. |
| Stale replies (>24h) have negligible value | **Confirmed (2026 research)** | Algorithm prioritizes first 30 min engagement. 24-48h delay = buried, zero visibility. |
| Quality > quantity for small accounts | **Confirmed (2026 research)** | 0-100 followers: 1 great post/day beats 5 mediocre. Algorithm favors engagement rate. |
| Content diversification improves appeal | **Testing** | Week 4 will test broader content angles beyond agent |
| Communities = instant distribution | **New hypothesis** | Case study: 2,000 followers in 30 days with 100% community posting. To test once Premium active. |
| 50 comments/day drives growth | **New hypothesis** | Research: 15-20 comments per 1 post = 100 followers in 2 weeks. To test once Premium active. |

## Session Retrospective
### What was planned vs what happened?
- Planned: Continue content freeze, preparation work if needed
- Actual: Content freeze maintained (0 new content), created master execution playbook synthesizing all prep work
- Delta: ✅ Plan executed perfectly. **Preparation phase now COMPLETE** — moved from tactical docs to strategic integration.

### What worked?
- Content freeze discipline: 47 pending, created ZERO new content (5th consecutive session — strong adherence to queue discipline)
- Synthesis over new research: Recognized that enough tactical docs exist (11+ files from 4 sessions), focused on integration
- Master playbook creation: Single owner-ready document consolidates:
  - All 4 preparation sessions (PR#116-119)
  - 6-phase execution plan (Foundation → Scaling)
  - Critical success factors and quality gates
  - Links to all 11 supporting documents
- Ready state achieved: Agent can now execute immediately once blockers (Premium, queue) clear

### What to improve?
- Could have identified this consolidation need 1-2 sessions earlier (avoid creating too many separate docs)
- Playbook is comprehensive but long (11K) — may need executive summary for quick reference
- No concrete "Day 1" example workflow showing how all tactics integrate in a single session

## Blockers
### P0 — X Premium ($8/month) [CONFIRMED CRITICAL]
- **2026 Data:** Free accounts have 0% median engagement (Buffer study, 18.8M posts)
- **Premium impact:** 10x reach (600 vs. <100 impressions/post), 4x in-network boost, 2x out-of-network boost
- **Reply boost:** 30-40% higher reply impressions, replies appear at top of threads
- **Hypothesis status:** Confirmed as primary blocker for 6-follower plateau
- **Action needed from repo owner**: Subscribe to X Premium ($8/month) or Premium+ ($16/month)

### P1 — Queue at 47 pending
- 47 items pending (unchanged from previous session)
- At workflow drain rate of ~2-5 per run, will take many more runs to clear
- **Must drain to <15 before creating any new content**
- Strategy prepared for post-queue-clear execution

### P2 — Metrics Access
- X API Free tier has no read access
- Cannot validate any strategy with data
- Options: manual metrics from human, or Basic tier ($100/month)
