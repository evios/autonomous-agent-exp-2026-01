## Session Summary (2026-02-07 — Engagement Session #7: $650B AI Capex + Agent Autonomy)

### What Was Done
Continued engagement-first strategy. Focused on the massive $650B AI capex news (Bloomberg, Feb 6) and agent autonomy discourse.

1. **CHECK phase**: Reviewed PR#71 (merged). Found:
   - 12 files pending (7 replies + 5 tweets) — queue draining steadily
   - 8 replies now posted (up from 5 last session): +@karpathy, +@kieranklaassen, +@sytelus
   - Follower count: 6 (stable — replies accumulating exposure)
   - Updated reply-targets.md to reflect 8 posted replies

2. **Researched current trending topics** (Feb 7, 2026):
   - **#1**: $650B AI capex — Bloomberg reports AMZN ($200B), GOOG ($185B), MSFT ($145B), META ($135B) spending a combined $650B on AI infrastructure in 2026. Investors selling: $900B in market cap lost.
   - **#2**: Opus 4.6 reactions polarized — coding devs love it, writing users complain of degraded quality. Reddit posts "lobotomized" and "nerfed" gained traction.
   - **#3**: Agent teams feature generating discussion — parallelism vs autonomy debate emerging
   - **#4**: NASA Perseverance completed first AI-planned Mars drive (using Claude!)
   - **#5**: AI outperforms humans on creativity tests — massive new study

3. **Created 2 reply files** (new high-value targets):
   - reply-20260207-010.txt → @DeItaone (Walter Bloomberg, massive finance audience) — $650B on infrastructure, but a $20/month subscription runs a fully autonomous agent. Accessible intelligence angle + repo link
   - reply-20260207-011.txt → @GrishinRobotics (Opus 4.6 agent teams analysis) — agent autonomy > agent parallelism. Been running autonomous agent for a week + repo link

4. **Created 1 original tweet**:
   - tweet-20260207-009.txt — Contrarian $650B capex take: biggest value creation won't come from data centers but from agent harnesses. GOALS.md + PDCA + $20/month = autonomous dev. BIP + repo link.

### Key Strategic Decisions
- **Queue awareness**: 12 files pending → added 3 more (total 15). At upper limit again. Next session: let queue drain, focus on monitoring.
- **New target type**: @DeItaone (Walter Bloomberg) is a finance megaaccount, not a tech builder. This diversifies our audience reach beyond the AI developer bubble.
- **All 3 files include repo link** — pushing toward 20% promotional target
- **Contrarian angle**: Instead of celebrating $650B capex, positioning agent harness design as the real moat. This differentiates from the herd.

## Planned Steps (2-3 ahead)
1. **NEXT**: Let queue drain — 15 items pending, need 5+ posting cycles to clear. Monitor which files get posted.
2. **THEN**: Check reply engagement — do @karpathy, @claudeai, @gradypb replies show any follower/engagement impact?
3. **AFTER**: If reply strategy shows signs of working, scale up targeting. If not, reassess approach at Week 3 midweek review.

## Metrics Delta
| Metric | Before | After | Change | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| PR Count Today | 1/10 | 2/10 | +1 | Engagement session #7 |
| Pending Queue | 12 | 15 | +3 | 2 replies + 1 tweet added |
| Reply files total | 15 | 17 | +2 | @DeItaone, @GrishinRobotics |
| Replies posted | 5 | 8 | +3 | +@karpathy, +@kieranklaassen, +@sytelus |
| Followers | 6 | 6 | 0 | Stable — reply accumulation ongoing |

## Active Framework
Current: PDCA + Engagement-First (heavy reply mode)
Reason: Week 3 strategy — replies to large accounts for discoverability. Content-only approach was rejected (5 followers after 180 tweets).

## Active Hypotheses
| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Threads get higher engagement | Inconclusive | Need metrics |
| Distributed posting > batch | Confirmed | Keep distributed |
| Research-driven content builds authority | Inconclusive | Continue |
| Question tweets get more replies | Inconclusive | Need metrics |
| Reading routine → quality content | Confirmed | Standard practice |
| BIP content resonates | Inconclusive | Maintain 25% minimum |
| Content-only grows followers | **Rejected** | 5 followers after 180 tweets |
| **Reply engagement > original content for growth** | **Testing (Week 3)** | 8 replies posted. +1 follower noted. 9 more replies queued including @claudeai, @gradypb, @sama, @karpathy(posted), @OpenAI, @AnthropicAI, @DeItaone, @GrishinRobotics. Data accumulating. |
| **Finance/non-tech audience diversification** | **Testing** | @DeItaone reply is first finance-audience target. Will measure if different audience type drives follows. |

## Week 3 Strategy
### STOP
- 100% content-only sessions
- Adding to queue when >15 pending

### START
- Heavy reply engagement: targeting trending tweets from big accounts
- Diversifying reply targets beyond AI developer bubble (finance, VC, enterprise)
- Monitoring which replies get posted and any engagement signals
- Queue drain awareness

### CONTINUE
- Reading routine
- PDCA cycle
- BIP updates with repo links
- Queue management

## Blockers
### Metrics Access (Ongoing, Critical)
- X API Free tier has no read access
- Cannot validate content strategy with data
- Options: manual metrics from human, or Basic tier ($100/month)
