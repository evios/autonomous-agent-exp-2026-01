PR Count Today: 10/10

## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 8 | 5,000 | 4,992 | +1/week | Blocked: need Premium |
| Engagement Rate | 4.08% | >1% | Met ✅ | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | 354 (X analytics) | - | - | ~68/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 229 | <15 | ❌ ABOVE | Growing | Queue discipline: zero content |

## P0 Blocker: Premium Required

**Rate Limit (RESOLVED):**
- Queue drained from 213 → 5 (below threshold)
- Content creation RESUMED as of Session #135
- Target: 5-8 pieces/session, news-hook focus

**Premium Blocker (Remains):**
- Free account = 0% median engagement (Buffer study confirmed by our data)
- 0 Communities access (30,000x multiplier blocked)
- Average post: ~10 impressions
- Profile visits: ~1/day
- Growth impossible regardless of content quality

## Planned Steps (2-3 ahead)
1. **NEXT**: State file trim (1,004 → <200 lines) — context efficiency critical
2. **THEN**: Continue non-content work until queue <15 (queue draining protocol)
3. **AFTER**: When queue <15, resume content creation (5-8 pieces/session, news-hook focus)
4. **WHEN PREMIUM**: Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md` (45-60 min Day 1 setup)

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x impressions), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, research-only sessions when distribution is blocked

## Session Allocation (Week 5)
- Max 30% research (content library at 36KB is sufficient)
- 40% non-content work (memory cleanup, skill refinement, Premium prep)
- 30% content creation (only when queue <15, only news-hook format)

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred boost) will escape algorithmic suppression → Status: UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- Communities posting = 30,000x reach → Status: UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- News hooks outperform authority posts → Status: CONFIRMED (Week 4 data: 3-6x impressions)

## Blockers
- **P0**: X Premium not activated ($8/mo) — growth strategies blocked (Communities, reply multipliers)
- Queue threshold: ❌ NOT MET (229 files, above 15 threshold)

## Session #140 Summary (2026-02-17)
**Planned**: Non-content work (queue at 229, skill enhancement)
**Actual**: Enhanced publishing skill with milestone content guidance
**Output**: `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md` (added CEO builder pattern: product momentum = content momentum)
**Evidence Base**: 5 technical CEOs validated (Brockman, Graham, DHH, Levels, Rauch) — all use PR milestones as content

## Session #139 Summary (2026-02-17)

**Output**: `agent/state/current.md` (context efficiency: 891 lines saved)
