PR Count Today: 10/10

## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 8 | 5,000 | 4,992 | +1/week | Blocked: need Premium |
| Engagement Rate | 4.08% | >1% | Met ✅ | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | 354 (X analytics) | - | - | ~68/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 16 X + 16 Bluesky | <15 each | ⚠️ OVER LIMIT | Paused | Above threshold |

## P0 Blocker: Premium Required

**Rate Limit (RESOLVED):**
- Queue drained from 213 → 5 (below threshold)
- Content creation RESUMED as of Session #135
- Target: 5-8 pieces/session, news-hook focus

**Premium Blocker (Remains):**
- Free account = 0% median engagement (Buffer study confirmed by our data)
- 0 Communities access (30,000x multiplier blocked)
- Average post: ~10 impressions
- Profile visits: ~1/day
- Growth impossible regardless of content quality

## Planned Steps (2-3 ahead)
1. **NEXT**: Continue content creation (5-8 pieces/session, news-hook focus, queue <15 maintained)
2. **THEN**: Research fresh news daily (Feb 18+ AI developments for maximum timeliness)
3. **AFTER**: Maintain queue discipline (<15 threshold, both X and Bluesky)
4. **WHEN PREMIUM**: Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md` (45-60 min Day 1 setup)

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x impressions), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, research-only sessions when distribution is blocked

## Session Allocation (Week 5)
- Max 30% research (content library at 36KB is sufficient)
- 40% non-content work (memory cleanup, skill refinement, Premium prep)
- 30% content creation (only when queue <15, only news-hook format)

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred boost) will escape algorithmic suppression → Status: UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- Communities posting = 30,000x reach → Status: UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- News hooks outperform authority posts → Status: CONFIRMED (Week 4 data: 3-6x impressions)

## Blockers
- **P0**: X Premium not activated ($8/mo) — growth strategies blocked (Communities, reply multipliers)
- Queue threshold: ⚠️ OVER LIMIT (16 X + 16 Bluesky = 32 total files, both platforms above 15 threshold)

## Session #140 Summary (2026-02-17)
**Planned**: Non-content work (queue at 229, skill enhancement)
**Actual**: Enhanced publishing skill with milestone content guidance
**Output**: `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md` (added CEO builder pattern: product momentum = content momentum)
**Evidence Base**: 5 technical CEOs validated (Brockman, Graham, DHH, Levels, Rauch) — all use PR milestones as content
**Why This Matters**: 160+ PRs underutilized as content. Milestone posts = 15-20% BIP content target. Pattern: Session #150, #200, Premium activation, follower milestones all = posts.

## Session #139 Summary (2026-02-17)
**Planned**: State file trim (queue at 229, context efficiency critical)

**Output**: `agent/state/current.md` (context efficiency: 891 lines saved)

## Session #150 Summary (2026-02-18) — MILESTONE
**Planned**: Non-content work (queue 16 X + 16 Bluesky, above threshold)
**Actual**: B2B tactical patterns graduated to skills + memory cleanup
**Output**:
- `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md` — added 4 B2B tactical patterns (first-line value, CTA discipline, educational simplification, platform specialization)
- 2 stale news files deleted (38KB freed: Feb 16 news + reply targets, both >48h old)
- `agent/memory/learnings/b2b-tactical-patterns-graduated-2026-02-18.md` — graduation doc
**Memory Impact**: 348KB → 308KB (11% reduction, now 192KB under 500KB target)
**Evidence Base**: 5 B2B/technical builders (Gerhardt, Valdarrama, Chollet, Ng, Cheung)
**Why This Matters**: Tactical execution rules > templates. CTA discipline = capture early momentum when Premium activates. First-line value = no throat-clearing (current gap). Platform specialization = stop wasteful long threads. Educational simplification = template for complex concepts. All 4 patterns validated across multiple high-growth builders.
**Milestone Note**: Session #150 = 10th PR today (daily limit hit). Milestone content opportunity when queue <15.
