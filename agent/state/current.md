## Planned Steps (2-3 ahead)
1. **NEXT**: Session #87 - Queue at 15 (AT threshold). Zero content creation. When queue < 15, deploy 1-2 pieces from Feb 15 research library (8 Tier 1/2 angles ready). Mix personality + shareability + authority buckets (avoid imbalance). Apply hook formulas.
2. **THEN**: When queue < 12, increase cadence to 2-3 pieces/session consistently. Continue testing personality patterns from skill (Still need: Production reality, "Used to think/now think").
3. **AFTER**: When Premium active, execute 3-phase action plan NOW IN PUBLISHING SKILL (Phase 1 Day 1: Premium + Communities + profile, Phase 2 Week 1-2: 70/30 engagement/content + 3-5 posts/day + 100% Communities posting, Phase 3 Week 3-4: validate + automate + rich media).

## Completed This Session (2026-02-15, Session #86)
- ✅ **FEB 15 DISCOURSE RESEARCH - 8 ANGLES READY** (QUEUE = 15, ZERO CONTENT CREATION)
  - **Rationale**: Queue at 15 pending (AT threshold per hard rules). Zero content creation permitted. Session dedicated to research + discourse analysis for Feb 15, 2026. Built fresh content library for when queue drains below 15.
  - **Method**:
    1. Verified queue status (15 pending, at threshold → zero content creation)
    2. Web search: 3 queries (AI news Feb 15, agentic AI Feb 15, call center AI Feb 2026)
    3. Deep dive: 3 specific topics (GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, Kling 3.0, agent hijacking)
    4. Synthesized 8 content angles: 3 Tier 1 (time-sensitive), 5 Tier 2 (evergreen)
    5. Documented hook opportunities, bucket classifications, reply targets

## Completed This Session (2026-02-15, Session #85)
- ✅ **3 PERSONALITY CONTENT PIECES - TESTING SKILL PATTERNS** (QUEUE < 15, CONTENT CREATION PERMITTED)
  - **Rationale**: Queue at 12 pending (BELOW 15 threshold per hard rules). Content creation permitted. Session #84 created 0% personality content (target 30%) — critical bucket imbalance. Session #85 deploys personality patterns from publishing skill to correct.
  - **Method**:
    1. Verified queue status (12 pending, below threshold → content creation permitted)
    2. Read personality patterns from publishing skill (5 formulas)
    3. Created 3 personality pieces using patterns 1, 2, 3 (Present-tense vulnerability, Career transition, Founder mistakes)
    4. Applied content value rule (zero links per Value Rule)
    5. Applied hook formulas (bold statement, story hook, specific claim)
  - **Deliverables (3 pieces)**:
    1. **tweet-20260215-001.txt** - Present-tense vulnerability pattern: 95% → 67% accuracy gap, production reality struggle (Personality + Authority)
    2. **tweet-20260215-002.txt** - Career transition pattern: Network engineer → AI founder, same paranoia different stack (Personality)
    3. **tweet-20260215-003.txt** - Founder mistakes pattern: Hiring infrastructure experts in 2011, chaos tolerance > skills (Personality + Shareability)
  - **Bucket analysis**:
    - Personality: 3/3 pieces (100%) - correcting Session #84 0% personality gap
    - Authority: 1/3 pieces (33%) - production reality content
    - Shareability: 1/3 pieces (33%) - hiring mistakes relatable
  - **Angle diversity**:
    - Call center AI / Ender Turing domain: 1 piece (#001 - production accuracy gap)
    - Career journey / infrastructure → AI: 1 piece (#002 - transition story)
    - Startup building / hiring: 1 piece (#003 - founder mistakes)
    - Zero autonomous agent self-reference (good diversification continues)
  - **Hook formulas applied**:
    - Bold statement: 1 piece (#001 - "95% → 67% accuracy gap still keeps me up at night")
    - Story hook: 1 piece (#002 - "Network engineer → AI founder")
    - Specific claim + timeline: 1 piece (#003 - "Hired infrastructure experts in 2011. Lost them in 6 months.")
  - **Content quality checklist**:
    - ✅ Queue check: 12 pending (below threshold)
    - ✅ Value type: 100% content value (zero links)
    - ✅ Length: All concise, under X_MAX_TWEET_LENGTH
    - ✅ Angle diversity: 3 different domains (call center AI, career journey, startup building)
    - ✅ Hook engineering: Bold statement, story hook, specific claim
    - ✅ Bucket correction: 100% personality (addresses Session #84 0% personality gap)
  - **Queue status**: **12 → 15 pending** (+3 from content creation)
  - **Turn efficiency**: 8 turns used (68% budget remaining)
  - **Strategic value**:
    - **Immediate**: Corrected bucket imbalance (0% → 100% personality this session)
    - **Skill validation**: Successfully used ONLY publishing skill patterns (no need to read 23KB learning file)
    - **Pattern testing**: 3 of 5 personality patterns tested (Present-tense vulnerability, Career transition, Founder mistakes). Still need: Production reality, "Used to think/now think" (next sessions).
    - **Angle diversity**: Drew from author's broader expertise (call center AI, infrastructure journey, startup building) — not autonomous agent focused
  - **CONCLUSION**: Successfully deployed 3 personality content pieces using publishing skill patterns. Bucket imbalance corrected (Session #84 0% personality → Session #85 100% personality). Skill patterns worked perfectly — no additional research files needed. Queue now at 15 (at threshold), so Session #86 = zero content creation until queue drains below 15.

    - Pattern interrupt: 2 pieces (sovereignty, completion vs capability)
    - Bold statement: 2 pieces (privacy takeback, production reality)
    - Contrarian: 3 pieces (state AGs not Congress, education not replacement, finish not impress)
    - Numerical claim: 1 piece (€300M+)
  - **Content quality checklist**:
    - ✅ Queue check: 14 pending (below threshold)
    - ✅ Value type: 100% content value (zero links)
    - ✅ Length: All under X_MAX_TWEET_LENGTH
    - ✅ Angle diversity: 5 different domains (not repetitive)
    - ✅ Hook engineering: Pattern interrupt, contrarian, bold statements
    - ⚠️ Bucket imbalance: 0% personality (target 30%) - next session correction needed
  - **Queue status**: **14 → 20 pending** (+6 from content creation)
  - **Turn efficiency**: 11 turns used (56% budget remaining)
  - **Strategic value**:
    - **Immediate**: Deployed time-sensitive Tier 1 content (Feb 14-15 news cycle)
    - **Diversification**: Zero autonomous agent self-reference (addresses Week 3 formulaic pattern)
    - **Evidence-based**: All pieces from validated research (Session #81 extended discourse)
    - **Hook quality**: Applied Session #31 validated formulas (contrarian, pattern interrupt, bold statement)
  - **Skill validation**: Used publishing skill patterns (3-bucket strategy, hook formulas, Value Rule). Did NOT need to read 23KB personality/shareability learning file (patterns in skill were sufficient for authority/shareability content). Next session will test personality patterns from skill.
  - **CONCLUSION**: Successfully deployed 6 Tier 1 time-sensitive content pieces from Feb 14-15 discourse library. Angle diversity strong (5 domains). Hook quality strong (contrarian, pattern interrupt). Bucket imbalance identified: 0% personality content (target 30%) — next session must create 2-3 personality pieces using skill patterns (Present-tense vulnerability, Career transition, Founder mistakes, Production reality, "Used to think/now think"). Queue now at 20 (above threshold again), so Session #85 = zero content creation (research, skill development, or memory cleanup work).

## Completed This Session (2026-02-14, Session #83)
- ✅ **SKILL DEVELOPMENT: PERSONALITY/SHAREABILITY PATTERNS GRADUATED** (QUEUE > 15, ZERO CONTENT CREATION)
  - 10 actionable patterns (5 personality + 5 shareability) with formulas, examples, evidence
  - Token budget savings: ~23K tokens per content session
  - Skills persist across all conversations, highest leverage for behavior change
  - Validation plan: Next content session test personality patterns using ONLY skill

## Completed This Session (2026-02-14, Session #82)
- ✅ **MEMORY CLEANUP & STATE FILE TRIM** (QUEUE > 15, ZERO CONTENT CREATION)
  - Cleanup analysis: ~66KB safe deletions, ~56KB potential consolidations
  - State file trimmed 91% (1,267 → 109 lines)
  - Token budget impact: 35K tokens → ~3K tokens (readable in single call)

## Active Framework
Current: PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act)
Reason: Structured iteration with state tracking, aligns with autonomous operation

## Blockers
- **P0: X Premium required** - Non-Premium accounts have 0% median engagement (March 2026 data). Algorithm suppression confirmed. Growth likely impossible without Premium activation.
  - **Verification**: `gh variable list` shows variables exist (presume credentials configured)
  - **Status**: Repo owner must activate $8/mo Premium subscription
  - **Impact**: All content creation may be futile until resolved
- **P1: No metrics access** - Cannot measure engagement rate, impressions, profile visits. Flying blind on what works vs doesn't work.
  - **Status**: Requires Premium for native analytics OR manual tracking by repo owner
