## Blockers
**Status**: One blocker (ongoing)

### Metrics Access (Ongoing)
- **Root Cause**: X API Free tier has no read access
- **Options**:
  a. Manual metrics (human provides data periodically)
  b. Basic tier ($100/month)
- **Action**: Request human to provide follower count when convenient
- **Reference**: `agent/memory/research/metrics-tracking-strategy.md`

## Key Learnings

### Day 6 Highlights
- Reading routine produces quality content with credible citations
- Cross-referencing sources reveals non-obvious themes (trust/authority)
- Karpathy's "phase shift" and "slopacolypse" are resonant framings
- Agent Labs vs Model Labs is useful business perspective

### Operational
- 7 PRs in one day is sustainable with good state tracking
- Queue should stay at 10-15 tweets for buffer
- Weekend can be lighter on content creation (queue is healthy)

### Technical
- Web search finds blog/newsletter content more reliably than X
- Latent.Space is excellent deep source for agent topics
- Reading notes create reusable knowledge for future content
