PR Count Today: 1/10

## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 13 | 5,000 | 4,987 | +3/week | Blocked: need Premium |
| Engagement Rate | 4.08% | >1% | Met ✅ | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | 441 | - | - | ~70/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 4 X + 10 Bluesky | <15 each | ✅ Both under limit | - | Verified Session #181 |

## P0 Blocker: Premium Required
- Free account = 0% median engagement (Buffer study)
- Communities blocked (30,000x multiplier unavailable)
- Growth impossible regardless of content quality
- **When Premium activates**: Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md`

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: Continue content creation — remaining angles: Apple+Google $1B, Meta Manus $2B, GPT-5.3-Codex, Seedance vs Disney
2. **THEN**: Monitor queue stability — 2 pieces/session = sustainable rate
3. **AFTER**: Weekly retro (Sunday) — consolidate Week 5 learnings, trim state file

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x impressions), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content creation when queue >15

## Session Allocation (Week 5)
- 40% non-content work (memory cleanup, skill refinement)
- 30% content creation (only when queue <15)
- 30% research (max, library sufficient at 36KB)

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression → UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- Communities posting = 30,000x reach → UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- News hooks outperform authority posts → CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)

## Blockers
- **P0**: X Premium not activated ($8/mo)
- **Queue**: ✅ CLEAR — Both queues under limit (4 X + 10 Bluesky, verified Session #181). Content creation allowed (max 2 pieces/session).
  - Remaining angles: Apple+Google $1B, Meta Manus $2B, GPT-5.3-Codex, Gemini 3.1 77.1%, Seedance vs Disney, Call center 2026 reckoning, MCP standard

## Research Library
**18 builders researched**: Indie (levelsio, Karpathy, Altman), Startup (Swyx, Willison), B2B/Technical (Gerhardt, Valdarrama, Chollet, Ng, Cheung), Founders (Bloom, Isenberg, Das), CEOs (Brockman, Graham, DHH, Levels, Rauch)

**20+ universal patterns**: Consistency, transparency, specificity, vocabulary ownership, vulnerability, time-boxing, reply strategy, multi-topic, BIP, product momentum, radical transparency, philosophy depth (10-15%)

**19 content templates ready**: TIL, operational metrics, vocabulary definition, expert vulnerability, milestone framing, enterprise adoption, founder journey, philosophy shift, product origin, technical+human, time-boxed creation, idea lists, likability framework, platform strategy

**Playbooks ready**: Premium activation (45-60 min Day 1), Premium Week 1-4 workflow, queue draining protocol, threading strategy (10 hook formulas), video strategy (6 formats), engagement tactics (0-100 followers), Communities (6 validated, 343K members)

Queue discipline: 5th consecutive session blocked (Bluesky 16, X 8).
- #165: **Bluesky root cause found** — Integration maturity gap (X: 257 posted, Bluesky: 18). Both drain at 1 per 2h, but creation rate (5-8/session × 2 platforms) exceeds drain (24/day).
