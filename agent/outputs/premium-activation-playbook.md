---

## Phase 2: Profile Optimization (30 min)

### Step 2: Update Profile Bio (5 min)

**Recommended Bio (107 characters):**
```
Building Voice AI for call centers. 7 years, 500K+ interactions. Production reality > vendor hype.
```

**Why this bio:**
- Credibility: "7 years, 500K+ interactions" (proof)
- Differentiation: "Production reality > vendor hype" (contrarian)
- Value prop: Clear expertise in Voice AI for call centers
- Length: 107 chars (research shows ~91 chars = highest follower conversion, white space improves readability)

**Alternative Bio Options:**

**Option 2: Dual Expertise (107 chars)**
```
Voice AI (Ender Turing, 7 years) + Autonomous agents (160 PRs). Production systems that survive reality.
```

**Option 3: Founder Journey (115 chars)**
```
Infrastructure engineer → AI founder. Helping teams ship Voice AI that works in production, not just demos.
```

**Option 4: BIP Focus (~130 chars depending on link)**
```
Running an autonomous agent experiment: 160 PRs, zero human intervention. Building Ender Turing (Voice AI). [repo link]
```

**To update:**
- Go to https://x.com/johniosifov (your profile)
- Click "Edit profile"
- Paste bio (Option 1 recommended)
- Save

---

### Step 3: Create Pinned Tweet (20 min)

**Recommended Format: Thread-Style Resume** (highest conversion for BIP founders)

**Thread (5 tweets, post as thread):**

```
Here's what I do:

1) Build Voice AI for call centers
   → 7 years in production
   → 500K+ interactions analyzed
   → 20% CSAT increase (Ender Turing)
---
2) Ship systems that survive production reality
   → Not demos that fall apart
   → 95% accuracy (demo) → 67% (production)
   → Integration hell is the real project
---
3) Run an autonomous agent experiment
   → 160+ PRs shipped, zero human intervention
   → Specification Engineering at scale
   → Building in public → https://github.com/evios/autonomous-agent-exp-2026-01
---
4) Infrastructure → AI journey
   → 15+ years: network engineer → NLP researcher → startup founder
   → Built and scaled OSIS (2011-2018)
   → Co-founded Ender Turing (2021-present)
---
Follow for production AI insights, not vendor hype.

Built by an autonomous agent. 321 tweets, 7 followers. Here's what happens when an agent learns to grow itself.
```

**Alternative Format: Vulnerability + Authority**

```
6 followers after 240 tweets. Here's what an autonomous agent taught me about production AI that benchmarks never will:

1) Agents need goals + measurement + permission to learn (not perfect instructions)
2) Soft rules drift. Hard rules hold. (PDCA requires binary constraints)
---
3) Production reality > vendor hype (95% → 67% accuracy = the truth)
4) Specification Engineering > Prompt Engineering (160 PRs = proof)

Building in public → https://github.com/evios/autonomous-agent-exp-2026-01

Follow for what actually works in production AI.
```

**To post as thread:**
1. Go to https://x.com/johniosifov
2. Click "Post" button
3. Write first tweet
4. Click "+" button to add next tweet in thread
5. Continue for all 5 tweets
6. Click "Post all"
7. Once posted, go to the thread
8. Click "..." menu → "Pin to your profile"

**Why this works:**
- Triple credibility (Voice AI + agent experiment + infrastructure background)
- Concrete proof (500K interactions, 20% CSAT, 160 PRs)
- Vulnerability (6 followers = relatable)
- Differentiation (production reality vs vendor hype)
- Clear CTA (Follow for...)

### Step 4: Banner Design (OPTIONAL - 30-60 min)

**Impact**: Well-designed banner = 30% boost in profile conversion

**Recommended Size**: 1500x500px

**Content Formula**: [Credibility] + [Proof/Result] + [Visual Interest]

**Banner Text Options:**

**Option 1: Proof-Driven**
```
500K+ Calls Analyzed | 20% CSAT Increase | 7 Years Voice AI Production
```

**Option 2: Contrarian**
```
Production Reality > Vendor Hype
95% Demo Accuracy → 67% Production Accuracy
```

**Option 3: BIP Focus**
```
Autonomous Agent Experiment: 160 PRs, Zero Human Intervention
Building Voice AI That Survives Production
```

## Phase 4: Manual Posting Workflow (5 min setup)

### Step 6: Set Up Daily Posting Routine

**Workflow (5 min/day):**

1. **Check Queue** (agent/outputs/x/)
   - Agent creates 1-2 pieces per session
   - Queue drains to ~10-15 items steady state

2. **Select Content** (top 1-2 pieces)
   - Prioritize: News hooks > personality > authority
   - Favor: Short posts (under 200 chars) > long posts
   - Favor: Content value (pure insight) > outcome value (with links)

3. **Post to Communities** (2-3 relevant communities)
   - Open content file
   - Go to https://x.com/johniosifov
   - Click "Post"
   - Paste content
   - Click "Choose audience" dropdown
   - Select 2-3 relevant Communities (e.g., "Build in Public" + "AI Builders")
   - **CRITICAL**: Check "Also share with followers" (dual distribution)
   - Click "Post"

4. **Engage Within 30 Min** (CRITICAL - 150x multiplier)
   - Monitor for replies/comments on your post
   - Reply to ALL comments within first 30 min
   - First 30 min engagement velocity = algorithm make-or-break window

**Communities Matching Guide:**

| Content Type | Post to Communities |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Autonomous agent progress | Build in Public, AI/ML Builders |
| Voice AI / call center insights | Call Center AI, AI/ML Builders |
| Founder lessons / startup stories | Startup Founders, Build in Public |
| Career transition (infra→AI) | Infrastructure→AI, Startup Founders |
| Product building / indie hacking | Indie Hackers, Build in Public |
| Production AI reality | AI/ML Builders, Startup Founders |

**Time Commitment**: 5 min/day (select + post + engage)

---

## Phase 5: Validation & Measurement (Ongoing)

### Step 7: Track Impact (Daily)

**Week 1-2 Expected Results:**
- Impressions: 600-2,000 per post (vs <100 baseline)
- Profile visits: 50-100/week (vs 1/day baseline)
- New followers: 50-100 in 2 weeks (vs 0 Week 4)
- Engagement rate: 2-5% (vs 4.08% current, but on 10x more reach)

**Metrics to Monitor:**

| Metric | Baseline (Free) | Target (Premium Week 1-2) | How to Check |
|--------|----------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| Impressions/post | ~10 | 600-2,000 | X Analytics → Tweet activity |
| Profile visits | 1/day | 50-100/week | X Analytics → Profile visits |
| Followers | 7 (+0 Week 4) | 50-100 in 2 weeks | Profile page |
| Engagement rate | 4.08% | 2-5% | X Analytics → Engagement rate |

**Check X Analytics:**
- Go to https://x.com/johniosifov
- Click "..." menu → "Analytics"
- View daily impressions, profile visits, follower growth

**Report to Agent** (so it can update state file):
- Post follower count update weekly
- Note any viral posts (>1,000 impressions)
- Flag what content performs best in Communities

---

## Phase 6: Automation Planning (Week 3-4)

### Step 8: Consider Publer (OPTIONAL)

**Trigger**: After Week 1-2 validation shows 10x follower growth

**Why Publer**:
- $10/mo Business plan
- Direct Communities posting API
- Automated workflow (no daily manual work)
- 95%+ reliability

**How it Works**:
1. Agent tags content with `# community: [ID]` in file
2. Modified `post.py` routes tagged files to Publer API
3. Publer posts to specified Communities automatically
4. Repo owner just monitors results

**Setup** (2-4 hours dev work):
1. Sign up: https://publer.io/
2. Connect X account
3. Get API key
4. Modify `agent/scripts/post.py` to call Publer API
5. Add Community IDs to agent's publishing skill

**Decision Point**: Week 3-4 after manual validation

---

## Troubleshooting

**If follower growth is slow (<50 in 2 weeks):**
1. Check posting frequency: Are you posting daily?
2. Check Communities posting: Are you clicking "Also share with followers"?
3. Check engagement: Are you replying within 30 min?
4. Check profile: Is bio clear? Is pinned tweet compelling?
5. Check content: Are you using news hooks (proven 3-6x multiplier)?

**If engagement rate drops:**
- Focus on shorter posts (under 200 chars)
- Use news hooks with dollar amounts
- Reply to larger accounts (<6h after they post)
- Engage with comments on your own posts within 30 min

**If Communities posts get no traction:**
- Verify you selected "Also share with followers"
- Check Community activity level (join more active alternative)
- Match content to Community focus (BIP content in BIP community)
- Post during peak hours (9 AM - 2 PM, 10-12 best)

---

## Next Steps After Day 1

**Week 1-2: Scale + Measure**
1. Post 1-2 pieces/day to Communities
2. Reply to ALL comments within 30 min
3. Create 5-10 replies/session to larger accounts
