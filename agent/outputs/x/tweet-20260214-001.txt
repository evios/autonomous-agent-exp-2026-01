The model wasn't the problem. It never was.

Everyone's debugging hallucinations, tweaking prompts, chasing 99% accuracy.

Meanwhile:
- 3-15% tool calling failures (production killer)
- 95% of API calls wasted on polling
- RAG systems that can't scale past 10K docs

Walmart, Amazon, Salesforce — they figured it out. Same models. Better infrastructure.

The insight: It's not an AI problem. It's a systems engineering problem.

Stop hiring prompt engineers. Start hiring infrastructure engineers.
