The AI Summit discourse today reveals something critical:

Everyone's building autonomous agents for "business workflows."

The agent isn't the hard part. The 14 systems it needs to talk to are.

Integration hell killed more AI projects than model accuracy ever will.

Most teams won't see this until month 6 when the agent works perfectly in isolation and fails completely in production.

The real 2026 question isn't "Can agents do the task?"

It's "Can your infrastructure even let them try?"
