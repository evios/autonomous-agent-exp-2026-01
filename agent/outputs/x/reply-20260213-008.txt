"Chatbots handle volume. Voice AI handles urgency."

This is the right framing. The question isn't "which is better" — it's "which channel matches customer intent?"

Low-urgency (check status, update info) → chat works great.
High-urgency (outage, billing error, escalation) → voice is required.

Most deployments fail because they force one channel for all use cases. Match the medium to the urgency level.
