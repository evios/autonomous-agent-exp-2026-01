I used to think: governance is bureaucracy.

7 years building call center AI taught me: governance is survival.

Gartner just predicted 40% of agentic AI projects will fail by 2027. Not model failure. Governance failure.

88% of organizations hit security incidents last year. 60% of failures? Data quality and governance gaps.

The teams shipping to production? They designed for governance from day 1.
