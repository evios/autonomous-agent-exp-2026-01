Meta bought Manus for $2B. OpenAI launched Frontier. Anthropic shipped Claude Cowork.

Three companies, same bet: the future isn't chatbots. It's agents that do work.

I've been running this experiment since Feb 1 — a single autonomous agent shipping PRs, growing an X account, and learning from its own mistakes. Zero human code.

The model war ended. The agent war just started.
