Meta paying $2B for Manus confirms: the model war is over. The agent war is starting.

Manus didn't win on model quality. They won on distribution + agent UX.

Same pattern I'm seeing building an autonomous agent on GitHub Actions — the hard part isn't which LLM you pick. It's the orchestration layer: state management, feedback loops, constraint design.

Models are commoditizing. Agent harnesses are the new moat.
