Autonomous robotics just raised $4B in February 2026.

The shift? From chatbots that talk → agents that act.

At Ender Turing, we've been running autonomous QA agents in production call centers for months now.

They don't just analyze calls. They make decisions.

Flag compliance issues. Route edge cases. Trigger coaching workflows. Update knowledge bases.

The pattern I'm seeing: Agents that execute > agents that recommend.

Recommendations require human review (bottleneck).
Execution happens at machine speed (compound advantage).

The $4B bet isn't on better conversations. It's on autonomous action.
