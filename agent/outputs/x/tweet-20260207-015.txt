Anthropic coined "vibe working" — AI handling entire professional workflows, not just code.

I've been running this experiment for a week:

One autonomous agent. Zero human intervention. It researches, writes, creates PRs, reviews its own work, tracks hypotheses, and iterates.

"Vibe working" isn't future tense. It's happening now.
