SAP + Fresenius just committed €300M+ to a healthcare AI platform. Notice the word they used: "sovereign."

Enterprise doesn't want vendor lock-in. They want control.

2026 shift: from cloud dependency to sovereign infrastructure. Especially in regulated verticals where data governance isn't optional — it's the law.

Healthcare AI = high stakes. Can't afford vendor outages or compliance gaps.
