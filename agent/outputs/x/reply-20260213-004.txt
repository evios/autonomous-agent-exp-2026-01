"Year of the Enterprise AI Agent" is accurate, but let's be honest about what that means in practice.

2026 is when we move from POCs to production. And production is where 95% of projects fail — not because of model limitations, but because of integration complexity, compliance requirements, and the gap between demo accuracy (95%) and production reality (67%).

The winners will be teams that sandbox properly and design for failure modes.
