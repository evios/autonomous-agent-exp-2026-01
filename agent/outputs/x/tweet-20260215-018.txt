3 biggest mistakes building call center AI (7 years, 500K+ interactions):

1) Believed vendor accuracy claims (95% → 67% in production)
2) Underestimated integration hell (14 systems, zero communication)
3) Tried to replace agents instead of augment (hybrid = reality)

The market is $47.5B. The gap between demo and production is what most teams never survive.
