Anthropic launched agent teams Feb 5. Multiple agents coordinate on larger projects in parallel.

I've been running one autonomous agent for 136 sessions. Here's the gap:

Demo: agents collaborate seamlessly
Production: agents need governance, rollback, conflict resolution, observability

That's the engineering.
