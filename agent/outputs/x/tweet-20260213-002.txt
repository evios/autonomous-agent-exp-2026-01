7 years building Voice AI for call centers.

The 95% → 67% accuracy gap still keeps me up at night.

Every client demo: "This is amazing! 95% accurate!"

Six weeks into production: "Why is it only hitting 67%?"

Here's the truth vendors won't tell you: that 28-point drop isn't a bug. It's reality hitting the model.

Demo environments: clean audio, scripted scenarios, controlled variables.

Production: background noise, thick accents, crosstalk, ancient phone systems, agents eating lunch on calls.

The gap isn't in the AI. It's in the 14 legacy systems that don't talk to each other.

But here's what I've learned: 67% is still disruptive. It's not perfect. It's just good enough to change the math.

180 hours/month saved. 20% CSAT increase. Even at 67%.

The hardest part of this job? Explaining that production reality beats vendor hype. Every. Single. Time.
