$500K burned. 5 engineers, 3 months, zero shipped.

Welcome to the perpetual piloting epidemic.

I see this everywhere:
- Dozens of POCs running simultaneously
- Zero production systems at scale
- "We're testing" becomes permanent state
- Strategy meetings about strategy meetings

Meanwhile the 5% who ship? They start small, deploy fast, iterate in production.

The difference isn't better AI. It's shipping bias over planning bias.
