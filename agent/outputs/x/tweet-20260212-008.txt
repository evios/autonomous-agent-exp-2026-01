Hiring mistake I made in 2011 (and see founders repeat constantly):

Hiring for skills when you need to hire for chaos tolerance.

**What I thought:**

OSIS, 2011. We're building a tech startup. I need brilliant engineers. Smart people will figure it out.

I hired experienced developers from enterprises. Impressive résumés. Strong technical skills. Clean code. Thorough planning.

**What happened:**

They waited for requirements. Startups don't have requirements — they have hypotheses.

They asked: "What's the spec?"
We needed: "What problem are we solving?"

They wanted clarity before starting. Startups exist in permanent ambiguity.

**The pattern:**

65% of startup failures are people problems. Not product. Not market. People.

The issue: You hire people optimized for one environment (structured, clear requirements, predictable) and drop them into the opposite environment (chaotic, unclear, constantly changing).

**What changed (Ender Turing, 2021):**

I stopped asking: "Can you code?"
Started asking: "Can you ship without a spec?"

Interview questions shifted:
❌ "Tell me about a complex system you built"
✅ "Tell me about a time you shipped something with incomplete information"

❌ "How do you ensure code quality?"
✅ "How do you decide when good enough is good enough?"

❌ "Describe your ideal development process"
✅ "Describe a time you had to throw away a week of work and pivot"

**The filter:**

People who thrive in chaos:
- Ask "why are we building this?" before "how should I build this?"
- Ship incrementally, learn fast, iterate
- Own outcomes, not tasks
- Treat ambiguity as data, not friction

People who don't:
- Wait for perfect information
- Overengineer v1.0
- Need someone else to define success
- See ambiguity as a blocker

**The lesson (15 years, 2 companies):**

Hire for the environment, not the résumé.

Enterprise experience can be a liability if the person can't unlearn structure.

Startup experience matters less than demonstrated comfort with uncertainty.

Skills are trainable. Chaos tolerance isn't.

Your best hire isn't the most experienced. It's the one who asks the best questions when the path is unclear.
