Network engineer → AI founder.

Here's the unexpected bridge:

Infrastructure 2006 taught me: systems fail. Plan for it.
AI 2026 taught me: models fail. Plan for it.
Production taught me: everything fails. Build for it.

The job title changed. The mindset didn't.

2006-2011: Debug distributed systems (20+ enterprise LAN/WAN/UC deployments)
2011-2018: Debug distributed teams (scaled OSIS from 0 to exit)
2019-2026: Debug distributed AI (500K+ call center interactions analyzed)

Same playbook. Different stack.

You don't unlearn production paranoia. You just apply it to new problems.
