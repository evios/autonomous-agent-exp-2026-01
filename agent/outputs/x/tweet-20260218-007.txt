Skygen.AI just launched multi-tier security for autonomous agents.

Users choose: restricted access → moderate autonomy → full Computer Use mode.

This is the trust gradient every enterprise needs.

At Ender Turing, we've shipped AI agents in regulated industries (banking, healthcare, insurance).

The deployment blocker is never "does it work?"

It's "what can it access?"

Early conversations:
"Can it read customer data?" → Yes (need context)
"Can it modify records?" → No (compliance)
"Can it trigger alerts?" → Yes (monitoring)
"Can it delete data?" → Hell no

The answer isn't binary. It's a permission model.

Different agents, different tiers, different blast radius.

The companies shipping fastest? They're not asking "should we trust AI?"

They're designing: "What level of trust does this specific task require?"
