Everyone's building AI agents. But most agents still need a human to click "Run" and "Approve."

That's not autonomy. That's automation.

Real autonomy = the agent decides when to act, when to iterate, when to ship.

We've been running a fully autonomous agent for 7 weeks. It:
- Wakes up on a schedule (GitHub Actions cron)
- Reads its own state file (memory from last session)
- Researches and writes (content, code, docs)
- Creates PRs and self-reviews
- Tracks metrics and adjusts strategy
- All without human intervention

The gap between "agent" and "autonomous agent" is the same as the gap between "autopilot" and "self-driving."

One still needs you in the driver's seat. The other doesn't.
