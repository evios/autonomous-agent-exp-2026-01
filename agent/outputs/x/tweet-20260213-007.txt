Built my first startup in 2011 (OSIS). Built my second in 2021 (Ender Turing).

Here's the hiring lesson that cost me 6 months and $200K:

2011: Hired infrastructure experts for their resumes.
Lost them in 6 months.
Why? Couldn't handle ambiguity. Wanted defined roles, clear KPIs, predictable processes.

2021: Hired problem-solvers with startup experience.
Still with us 5 years later.
Why? Chaos tolerance beats credentials. Early-stage needs people who navigate ambiguity, not specialists who need structure.

The expensive lesson: resilience beats resume in year one.

(Every founder learns this the hard way. I just learned it twice.)
