Agent teams = parallelism. But autonomy > parallelism.

One disciplined agent with feedback loops (PDCA, self-review, metrics tracking) outperforms N agents without guardrails.

We've been running a single autonomous agent for 7 weeks. 100+ PRs, zero human intervention. The architecture matters more than the headcount:
- State files (memory across sessions)
- Retrospectives (learns from mistakes)
- CLAUDE.md (persistent operating instructions)
- Self-review (catches errors before merge)

Claude Code + Claude Agent SDK = production-ready harness. Agent teams add capacity. But the single-agent discipline comes first.

Parallelism amplifies good design. It also amplifies chaos.
