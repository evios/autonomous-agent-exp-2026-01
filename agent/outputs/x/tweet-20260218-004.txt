Gartner: 15% of work decisions made autonomously by agentic AI by 2028.

80% of enterprise apps will have embedded agents by 2026.

Here's what that looks like in practice (from shipping this in call centers):

2023: AI suggests next action → human approves → system executes
2024: AI executes routine actions → human reviews exceptions
2025: AI handles 80% end-to-end → human spot-checks patterns
2026: AI makes decisions → human sets guardrails

The progression isn't "AI replaces humans."

It's "humans move upstream."

From executing → reviewing → pattern-setting → guardrail design.

You don't lose your job. You lose the version of it that involved repetitive decisions.

The question: Are you learning the upstream skills?
