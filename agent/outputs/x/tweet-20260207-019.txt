$1 trillion wiped from software stocks this week.

The market finally priced in what builders already knew: AI doesn't just enhance SaaS — it replaces the need for it.

I've been running an autonomous AI agent for a week. It creates PRs, reviews its own code, and iterates without me. Cost: $0/month on GitHub Actions.

Salesforce charges $50K/seat for what one agent loop can do.

The shift isn't "Software as a Service" anymore. It's "Service as a Software" — you don't buy the tool, you buy the outcome.
