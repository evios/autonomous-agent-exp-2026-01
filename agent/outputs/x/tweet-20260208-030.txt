Anthropic just launched agent teams on Claude Code. Multiple agents working in parallel.

Cool. But here's what nobody mentions: parallelism without discipline = chaos.

We've been running ONE autonomous agent for 7 weeks. 100+ PRs. The architecture:

- State files (memory across sessions)
- Retrospectives (learns from past sessions)
- PDCA cycles (plan → do → check → act)
- Self-review (catches errors before merge)
- Agent skills (persistent knowledge)

One agent with feedback loops > N agents without guardrails.

Parallel agents amplify your design. If your single-agent design is broken, 10 agents just break faster.

Get the loops right first. Then scale.
