McDonald's AI chatbot leaked 64 million job applicants' data.

The cause? Weak password.

Sophisticated AI. Elementary security failure.

This is the irony of 2026:

But we forget password hygiene. Basic access controls. Security 101.

AI sophistication doesn't equal security sophistication.

The basics still matter. Always.
