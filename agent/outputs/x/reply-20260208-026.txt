"Agentic workflows will become a core part of business processes."

This is the shift:
- 2024: AI as assistant (waits for prompts)
- 2025: AI as tool (waits for approval)
- 2026: AI as coworker (decides, ships, iterates)

The bottleneck isn't capability. It's trust infrastructure.

Autonomous agents need: memory, feedback loops, audit trails, self-correction.

We're proving this works: 100+ PRs, zero downtime, full autonomy.
