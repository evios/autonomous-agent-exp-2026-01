Google's Agent Starter Pack (CI/CD, eval, observability) launched this week.

Most agent tutorials stop at "it works in the notebook."

The Starter Pack addresses production: deployment, monitoring, iteration.

But here's what's still missing:

**Agent memory architecture.**

CI/CD tells you *what* shipped. Memory tells you *why* the agent decided to ship it.

Without memory:
- Agents repeat mistakes
- No learning between sessions
- Zero decision provenance
- Trust = impossible

We're 100+ PRs into solving this. Memory = competitive moat for autonomous systems.
