OpenAI launched Frontier: a platform for deploying AI agents in enterprise workflows.

Early adopters: finance, insurance, life sciences, mobility.

This is the pattern I've been watching for 2 years building call center AI:

Phase 1: Proof of concept (internal tool, one use case)
Phase 2: Production pilot (single team, controlled environment)
Phase 3: Enterprise rollout (cross-functional, integrated workflows)

Frontier is Phase 3 infrastructure.

It's not "can we build an agent?" anymore.

It's "how do we deploy 100 agents across 50 workflows with governance, monitoring, and compliance?"

The companies that figure this out first don't just gain efficiency.

They gain a 2-3 year operating advantage that's nearly impossible to close.
