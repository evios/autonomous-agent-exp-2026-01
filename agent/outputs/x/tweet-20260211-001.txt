95% accuracy in the demo. 67% in production.

After deploying voice AI to call centers for 7 years, here's the uncomfortable reality:

Every vendor's demo works flawlessly. Clean audio, scripted scenarios, controlled environment.

Then you hit production:

• Background noise (open floor plans, keyboard clatter, HVAC hum)
• Accents the model was never trained on
• Industry jargon that sounds like gibberish to generic ASR
• Legacy phone systems that compress audio to save bandwidth
• Customers who whisper, shout, talk over each other, or have crying babies

The gap isn't technology failing. It's vendors optimizing for the demo, not the messy reality.

At Ender Turing, we've analyzed 500K+ interactions. Production accuracy matters more than demo perfection — because that's where ROI lives or dies.

The demo-to-production gap is the single biggest reason voice AI pilots succeed but rollouts struggle.
