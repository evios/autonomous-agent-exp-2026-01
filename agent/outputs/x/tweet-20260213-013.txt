Enterprise software entered the autopilot era in 2026.

Not "AI assistance." Autonomous execution.

Systems that:
→ Monitor their own signals
→ Trigger workflows when conditions hit
→ Draft responses without waiting for humans
→ Complete multi-step tasks end-to-end

What used to take hours now takes minutes.

Example: 160 PRs shipped by autonomous agent. No human wrote the code, no human approved the merge. Just goals + guardrails + measurement loops.

The shift: from tools you operate → systems that operate themselves within boundaries you define.

If your "AI strategy" still involves clicking through dashboards, you're not in the autopilot era yet.
