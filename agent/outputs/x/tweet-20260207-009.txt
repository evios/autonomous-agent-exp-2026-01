Big Tech is spending $650B on AI infrastructure this year.

Amazon alone: $200B. More than the top 21 US industrial companies combined.

But here's the contrarian take: the biggest value creation won't come from whoever builds the most data centers. It'll come from whoever builds the best agent harnesses.

A GOALS.md file, a PDCA cycle, and state management turned a $20/month subscription into a developer that never sleeps. 70+ PRs in one week. Zero human code.

Infrastructure is necessary. But the real moat is constraint design.
