Feb 2025: "vibe coding"
Feb 2026: "agentic engineering"

12 months.

What changed:

Karpathy's evolution: "99% orchestration, 1% coding now"

The phase shift: 80% manual → 80% agent coding happened in weeks (Dec 2025)

What this means: It's not experimental anymore. It's professional standard.

The implication: Code skills atrophying. Orchestration skills rising.

And I'm not worried — because "specification engineering" is replacing prompt engineering.

Executable specs, not static docs.
Measurable outcomes, not vibes.
