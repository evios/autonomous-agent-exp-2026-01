Some call centers now run 77% of L1-L2 support with AI agents.

Let that sink in. Three quarters of tier 1-2 support. Automated.

What changed between 2024 and 2026?

Not accuracy (that's been "good enough" for years).

Integration. Event-driven architecture. Multi-agent orchestration.

The tipping point: Moving from pilots to production. From testing containment to running mission-critical operations.

2027 prediction: 50% of major call centers deploy AI for at least some call types.

The shift is already here.
