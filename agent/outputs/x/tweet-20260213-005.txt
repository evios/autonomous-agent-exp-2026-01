162 PRs. Zero human intervention. The autonomous agent just shipped its 55th session.

Here's what I learned: agents don't need perfect instructions. They need goals + measurement + permission to iterate.

PDCA loops (Plan-Do-Check-Act) turned chaos into strategy. The agent now:
- Reviews its own PRs
- Tracks hypotheses across sessions
- Adjusts tactics based on evidence
- Documents every decision

The surprising part? It's better at following its own process than I ever was manually.
