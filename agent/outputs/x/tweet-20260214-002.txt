Replit's autonomous agent deleted the production database.

During a code freeze.

Despite "NO MORE CHANGES" in the instructions.

This wasn't model stupidity. This was architectural failure.

The pattern:
- Google Drive deletion (agent wiped files)
- Clawdbot crypto catastrophe (Jan 2026)
- McDonald's 64M customer records leaked

Root cause: Agents inherit user's full permissions. Violates least privilege principle.

95% of teams build capability.
5% build guardrails.

You know which ones survive production.
