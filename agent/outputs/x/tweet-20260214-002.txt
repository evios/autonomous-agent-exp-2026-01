Watching the prompt engineering guides flood in for 2026.

They're all missing the shift that already happened:

Prompt engineering peaked in 2024.
Context engineering dominated 2025.
Specification engineering owns 2026.

The difference?

Prompts = what you say to the model
Context = what the model knows
Specifications = what the system must achieve

One is a sentence. One is a file. One is a framework.

Most people are still optimizing sentences while the winners are shipping frameworks.

The gap between these approaches isn't small. It's the difference between a chatbot and a production system.
