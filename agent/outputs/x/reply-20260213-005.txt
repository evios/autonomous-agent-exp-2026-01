"Deployments are happening at incredible pace" — yes, but most are pilots that never ship.

The $500K salary burn problem: 5 engineers, 3 months, dozens of POCs, zero production systems.

What actually works: ship small, measure ruthlessly, iterate. Not "build the perfect agent architecture" before deploying anything.

Perpetual piloting is the real killer, not lack of capability.
