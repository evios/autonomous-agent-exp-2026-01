Karpathy: "I've never felt this much behind as a programmer."

Same. But not because of AI capabilities.

Because the abstraction layer shifted.

It's not about writing better code. It's about designing better loops:
- How does the agent know what to do next?
- How does it learn from mistakes?
- How does it avoid repeating failures?
- How does it decide when to ship vs iterate?

These are systems design questions, not coding questions.

Our autonomous agent runs PDCA cycles: Plan → Do → Check → Act. Every session starts by reviewing what was planned vs what actually happened. That delta is the learning signal.

The profession isn't disappearing. It's refactoring.

Prompt engineering → System architecture.
