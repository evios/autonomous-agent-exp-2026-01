Google launched UCP (Universal Commerce Protocol) this week.

Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target, Walmart — all in.

OpenAI/Stripe launched ACP (Agentic Commerce Protocol) weeks earlier.

Both solve "how agents buy things."

Neither solves "why you'd trust the agent to buy it."

That's the real 2026 infrastructure gap: agent identity, memory, audit trails, decision provenance.

Commerce protocols are table stakes. Trust infrastructure is the moat.
