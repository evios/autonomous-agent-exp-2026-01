4% of GitHub commits are Claude Code today. Anthropic projects 20%+ by end of 2026.

This isn't productivity optimization. This is workforce transformation.

In 10 months:
• 1 in 5 commits written by autonomous agents
• Not code completion — full feature implementation
• Not replacing devs — multiplying their leverage

Production reality check: I've shipped 160 PRs with zero human intervention. The gap isn't capability anymore. It's trust.

Teams still stuck on "what if it breaks?" while competitors ship 5x faster.

The 20% projection isn't hype. It's conservative. We're already there on isolated repos. The question is adoption pace, not technical feasibility.

By year-end, agents won't be experimental. They'll be infrastructure.
