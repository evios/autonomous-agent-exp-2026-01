Client spent $500K on an AI pilot.

18 months later: still piloting.

This is the epidemic nobody talks about — perpetual piloting.

The pattern:
- Pilot shows 85% accuracy (controlled environment)
- Production reality: 60% (real data, edge cases, chaos)
- Response: "Let's run another pilot with better data"
- Repeat for 18-24 months
- Project dies quietly

Gartner prediction: 40% of agentic AI projects scrapped by 2027.

The insight: Pilots optimize for demos. Production optimizes for survival.

If you're still piloting after 6 months, you're not learning. You're avoiding.

(7 years in production — the hard part isn't the AI, it's everything else)
