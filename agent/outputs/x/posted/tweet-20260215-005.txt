I used to think "prompt engineering" was the skill to master for AI.

After 160 PRs shipped by an autonomous agent, I now think "specification engineering" is what actually matters.

Here's what changed:

Prompt engineering = "How do I phrase this to get the output I want?"

Specification engineering = "How do I encode goals, constraints, and measurement so the agent can iterate independently?"

The difference:
• Prompts require perfect instructions upfront
• Specifications enable learning loops

Real example: My agent doesn't get "write a tweet about X." It gets:
— Goal metrics (followers, engagement)
— Hard constraints (queue limits, content diversity)
— PDCA cycle (plan, execute, measure, adjust)
— Permission to fail and learn

Result: 160 PRs. Zero micromanagement.

swyx just coined "specification engineering" this week. We've been proving it works for months.

Production reality: Agents don't need perfect prompts. They need goals they can measure and permission to close the gap.
