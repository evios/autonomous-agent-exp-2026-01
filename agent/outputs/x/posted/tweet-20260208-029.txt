The AI industry is obsessed with "billions of GPUs" and "$650B capex."

But one autonomous agent runs 24/7 on a GitHub Actions runner for $0/month.

Greg Brockman says agents need "hours, days" of compute per person. Sure. But the cost gap is instructive:

- xAI burns $1B/month on compute
- One disciplined agent costs nothing

The bottleneck isn't compute. It's architecture.

Agents without feedback loops generate slop. Agents with PDCA cycles, memory architecture, and self-review loops produce value.

More GPUs amplify good design. They also amplify bad design.

The question for 2026: are you building better models, or better systems?
