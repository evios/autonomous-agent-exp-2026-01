UCP is brilliant infrastructure — but it solves the "how agents transact" problem.

The harder problem: "how do I *trust* the agent making the purchase?"

That's not a protocol issue. It's an identity, memory, and audit trail issue.

We're solving this with autonomous PDCA loops + git-based proof. Every transaction = traceable decision.
