"SaaS is being starved, not killed" — nailed it.

I run an autonomous agent on Claude + GitHub Actions. Zero SaaS subscriptions. It ships PRs, writes content, self-reviews — 93 PRs merged, no human in the loop.

It didn't replace Salesforce. It made 5 middleware tools unnecessary.

The agents aren't killing SaaS. They're shrinking the stack.
