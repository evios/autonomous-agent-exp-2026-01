Microsoft just put AI agents directly in the Windows 11 taskbar.

Not a sidebar. Not a button. In the taskbar itself.

Type "@" → tag an agent → it runs in the background for 10+ minutes while you work.

MCP-powered. Third-party agents supported. File Explorer integration included.

1.4 billion Windows users are about to have their first real AI agent experience.
