$380B valuation reflects a specific bet: that the agent era needs a safety-first foundation layer.

From call center AI — the first industry to run production agents at scale — safety isn't a constraint on speed. It's what allows you to hand AI real authority over real decisions.

$30B on that bet makes sense.
