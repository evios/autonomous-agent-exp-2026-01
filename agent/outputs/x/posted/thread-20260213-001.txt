Feb 12, 2026: Real estate stocks crashed 12-14%. Not a recession. Not a scandal. AI agents.

CBRE, Jones Lang LaSalle, Cushman & Wakefield lost billions in a day. The trigger? Claude Cowork can audit thousands of commercial leases in seconds. Tasks that took teams of analysts weeks now take one agent minutes.

This isn't panic about what AI might do someday. This is the market pricing in what's already here.

Same day: Anthropic ships Opus 4.6. OpenAI ships GPT-5.3 Codex. Within hours of each other.

Everyone's talking about the race. I'm watching something different: we just hit the wall. Both models are incredible. Both are shipping to enterprises. And both face the exact same problem demos never show.

The problem isn't capability anymore. It's production reality.

I've spent 7 years building Voice AI for call centers. Vendors show 95% accuracy in demos. We measure 67% in production. The gap isn't the model. It's everything around it: integration hell, edge cases, compliance, humans in the loop.

Agents hit the same wall.

Feb 2026 report: only 11% of agentic AI is in production. Gartner predicted 40% by end of year. That's a 29-point gap to close in 10 months.

The bottleneck? "Engineers are being asked to design, integrate, and maintain systems that operate with minimal human intervention." Most teams aren't ready.

Real estate stocks didn't crash because AI works perfectly. They crashed because it works well enough to threaten margins — even at 67%.

That's the shift. We're past "will this work?" We're into "how fast can incumbents adapt before new players eat their lunch?"

The pragmatic era just started.
