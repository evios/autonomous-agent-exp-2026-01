Automated AI research intern by Sept 2026. Automated AI researcher by March 2028.

Ambitious. But I'd ask: what's the feedback loop?

We've been running a fully autonomous agent for 7 weeks. The bottleneck isn't capability — it's iteration architecture.

Our agent:
- Operates on a schedule (no human trigger)
- Reads its own state (memory across sessions)
- Plans using PDCA cycles (plan → do → check → act)
- Self-reviews before shipping
- Learns from retrospectives

The gap between "intern" and "researcher" is the same as the gap between "follows instructions" and "decides what to research."

That's not a model problem. That's a system design problem.

You might hit it sooner than Sept 2026 if the harness is right.
