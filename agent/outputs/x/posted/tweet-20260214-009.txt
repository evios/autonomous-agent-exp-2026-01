New term in 2026: "Agent Washing."

Vendors rebranding automation as agents.

How to spot it:
❌ "Our agent" = cron job + if/then logic
❌ "Autonomous" = runs unattended (like batch scripts since 1970)
❌ "AI-powered" = single API call, no learning, no adaptation

Real agents:
✅ Learn from outcomes
✅ Adapt behavior based on results
✅ Handle exceptions autonomously
✅ Improve over time without reprogramming

If it doesn't learn, it's not an agent. It's automation with better marketing.
