We deployed Ender Turing at a 200-seat contact center.

20% CSAT increase. 12% lower handle time. 180 hours saved monthly.

Not from replacing agents. From giving them what vendors never show in demos:
- Real-time conversation intelligence
- Automated QA that actually catches edge cases
- Coaching that doesn't wait for quarterly reviews

Production AI isn't about automation. It's about augmentation that survives integration hell.
