New term in 2026: "Agent Washing."

Vendors rebranding automation as agents. Here's how to spot it:

Real agents:
→ Autonomous decision-making (not scripted workflows)
→ Learn from outcomes (not static rules)
→ Handle exceptions (not just happy paths)
→ Operate with goals (not just task lists)

Automation with a chatbot slapped on ≠ agent.

95% of "agentic AI" is just automation theater. The 5% that's real? You'll know because it fails in production and learns from it.

If it worked perfectly on day 1, it's not an agent. It's a well-configured cron job.
