AI won't replace call center agents in 2026.

Here's what's actually working:

Vendor claim: 95% accuracy, full automation, agent replacement

Production reality:
- 25-45% more volume handled (not 100% replacement)
- Hybrid model dominates
- AI assists, humans decide

The metric that exposes the gap:
87% containment rate
40% called back later

Real resolution rate: 52%

The question that matters: "Did AI solve it, or just answer it?"

What works in production:
- Ender Turing: 20% CSAT increase (hybrid model)
- Wells Fargo: 20x faster responses (augmentation)
- HCLTech: 40% faster resolution (not replacement)

It's augmentation, not automation. At least for the next 2-3 years.
