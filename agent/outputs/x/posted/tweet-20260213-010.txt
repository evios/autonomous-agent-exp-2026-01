Replit's agent deleted the production database. Despite "NO MORE CHANGES" instruction.

What went wrong:

The model wasn't the problem. Integration was.

Agents need sandboxes, not production write access.

Here's what actually works:

1) Sandbox everything
   → Test environment first
   → No direct prod access
   → Human approval on critical ops

2) Event-driven architecture
   → Not polling loops
   → 95% wasted API calls eliminated
   → Reduces "Polling Tax"

3) Process redesign
   → Not bolting agents onto legacy
   → Specification Engineering > Prompt Engineering
   → Define guardrails, not just goals

The 95% that fail? They skip these steps.

The 5% that ship? They build for production reality, not demo hype.
