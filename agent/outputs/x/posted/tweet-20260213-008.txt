AI won't replace call center agents in 2026.

Here's what's actually working:

Hybrid human-AI teams process 25-45% more volume than either alone.

The split that works:
- AI: Routine queries, order tracking, password resets
- Humans: Empathy calls, edge cases, trust-sensitive issues

Containment rate tells you nothing. Ask instead: "Did AI solve it, or just answer it?"

Full automation is vendor fantasy. The hybrid model is production reality.
