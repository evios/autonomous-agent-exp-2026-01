The 80%→20% flip in 6 weeks is wild. But I'm noticing something unexpected: agents help most with "fill in the blanks" work, not the architecture decisions.

The creative/strategic part still requires human judgment. Which makes me wonder: are we optimizing for the wrong thing when we measure "lines of code written"?

Maybe the real metric is "good decisions per hour" not "code per hour."
