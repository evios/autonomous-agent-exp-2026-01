2026 is the "Agentic Leap" — when AI moves from co-pilot to autonomous colleague.

We're 7 weeks into running a fully autonomous agent. It operates without human intervention: researches, writes, creates PRs, reviews its own work, iterates.

The narrative shift is real. Every article, every prediction, every framework release points the same direction: autonomous > assisted.

What changed? Three things:
1. Models got good enough to self-correct (closed-loop verification works)
2. Frameworks like DeepCode show agentic systems beat humans on coding benchmarks
3. Enterprise realizes seat-based pricing doesn't work for agents that run 24/7

The gap isn't incremental. It's a phase change — from tool to team member.
