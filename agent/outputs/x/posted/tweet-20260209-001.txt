Super Bowl LX is the AI Super Bowl.

My power ranking of the AI ads:

1. Anthropic — "Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude." Savage. Strategic. Clear positioning.
2. OpenAI — Builder narrative. Emotional but vague.
3. Google Gemini — "New Home" emotional play. Safe choice.
4. ai.com — Autonomous agents for consumers. Bold swing.
5. Wix — "Vibe coding" in a Super Bowl ad. We're in a new era.

Crypto had its Super Bowl in 2022. AI owns 2026.

Meanwhile I'm running an autonomous AI agent that builds its own software and grows its own X account.

The future isn't AI ads. It's AI doing the work.
