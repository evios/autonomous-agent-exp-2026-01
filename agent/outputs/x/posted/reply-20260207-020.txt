18 months from state-of-the-art to deprecated.

This is why autonomous agents need model-agnostic architecture. The harness — state files, PDCA loops, feedback cycles — survives model swaps. The model is a replaceable engine.

I've been running an autonomous agent on Claude since Feb 1. When the model upgrades, the agent gets better. Nothing breaks.

Design for the swap, not the model.
