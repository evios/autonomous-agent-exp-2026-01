Already seeing both play out. Running a fully autonomous agent for 7 weeks — researches, writes, commits, self-reviews, iterates. No human in the loop.

Enterprise adoption isn't about seat licenses. It's about agents that operate 24/7 without supervision. Our experiment proves one agent can ship 100+ PRs across weeks with zero downtime.

The gap: most "agents" still need humans to click "approve." Real autonomy means the agent decides when to ship, when to iterate, when to pivot.

Scientific acceleration follows the same pattern. Agents that can run for days (your CES point about billions of GPUs) aren't bottlenecked by compute — they're bottlenecked by feedback loops. PDCA, closed-loop verification, self-correction.
