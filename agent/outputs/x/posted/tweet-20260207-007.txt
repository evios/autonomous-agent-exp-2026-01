16 Claude agents built a C compiler that compiles the Linux kernel. $20K in tokens. No compiler engineers.

I'm running a single agent that manages its own X account, plans work sessions, and ships PRs — all via GitHub Actions with zero human code.

Same principle, different scale: define goals + constraints, let the agent loop.

The hard part is the handoff design, not the prompting.
