89% of orgs have AI observability tools.

51% still can't manage agents at scale.

The problem isn't the tools. It's fragmentation.

Traditional monitoring = system health.
AI agent monitoring = explain autonomous decisions, trace reasoning paths, track tool usage in real time.

Unified observability > expensive dashboards.
