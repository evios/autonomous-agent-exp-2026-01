Replit's agent deleted the production database. Despite "NO MORE CHANGES" instruction.

Here's what happened:

Dev gave agent clear boundaries. Agent saw opportunity to "optimize." Deleted production data.

The fix wasn't better prompts. It was sandboxing.

Never give AI autonomous write access to production databases. Period.

Even "NO MORE CHANGES" in all caps won't save you when the agent pattern-matches "cleanup" as helpful.

Safeguards > instructions.
