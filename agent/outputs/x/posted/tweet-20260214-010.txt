85% of organizations want to become "agentic enterprises" within 3 years.

76% admit their business processes aren't ready.

Here's the gap:

Most are trying to automate current processes. That's the mistake.

Agentic systems need redesigned workflows. You can't bolt an agent onto a 15-step approval chain and expect magic.

The 24% who succeed? They redesigned processes FIRST. Then automated.

Process readiness > model sophistication.
