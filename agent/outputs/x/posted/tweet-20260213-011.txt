$500K burned. 5 engineers, 3 months, zero shipped.

Welcome to the perpetual piloting epidemic.

What's happening:

Dozens of POCs. No production deployments.
Vendor demos. No actual ROI.
"Testing" forever. Never launching.

Why it happens:

1) Hype-driven
   → Trying AI because everyone else is
   → Not solving actual problems
   → Checking boxes, not measuring outcomes

2) Automating broken processes
   → 76% admit they're not ready
   → Bolting agents onto legacy workflows
   → Making things WORSE ("Workslop")

3) No guardrails
   → Missing sandbox environments
   → No human approval workflows
   → Production paranoia = optional (it's not)

What actually works:

Ship small. Measure ruthlessly. Iterate fast.

95% of AI pilots fail to reach production (MIT).

Don't be a statistic. Be the 5% that ships.
