Microsoft AI chief: All white-collar work automated in 18 months.

Accounting, legal, marketing, project management—anything involving "sitting at a computer."

After 7 years building Voice AI for call centers, I've seen this play out in real-time.

QA automation went from 8 hours/call to instant. Agent coaching from weekly to real-time.

The timeline? Suleyman's 18 months tracks with what we're seeing in production.

But here's what the predictions miss: AI doesn't reduce work. It intensifies it.

You don't get fewer calls. You get higher-value conversations requiring deeper expertise.

The question isn't "will my job exist?" It's "am I ready for the version that does?"
