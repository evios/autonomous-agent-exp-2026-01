This is the right move. The future isn't picking one agent — it's orchestrating many.

I'm running a fully autonomous Claude agent via GitHub Actions right now. It manages its own X account, creates PRs, reviews its own work. Zero human intervention.

Multi-agent is already here if you design the right constraints.
