Infrastructure engineer (2006) → Startup founder (2011) → AI product leader (2021).

15 years. Two companies. Here's what actually transferred (and what didn't):

**What transferred:**

Systems thinking - Designing network topologies taught me to plan for 10x scale from day one. Infrastructure fails when you design for today's load. Startups fail when you hire for today's problems.

Redundancy mindset - In networks, single points of failure kill everything. In startups, founder dependencies are the same risk. If only you can make a decision, you're the bottleneck. Train others to decide.

KISS principle - Complex network designs are impossible to debug. Complex business models are impossible to scale. The simplest solution that works beats the elegant solution that requires 6 dependencies.

Capacity planning - You don't wait until the network is saturated to upgrade. Same with startup hiring. By the time you're desperate, you're 3 months behind. Hire for 2 stages ahead.

**What didn't transfer:**

Clarity expectation - In infrastructure, you document everything before you build. In startups, you build to figure out what to document. Engineers wait for specs. Founders create specs by shipping.

Risk tolerance - Networks need 99.99% uptime. Startups need controlled experiments. I spent 6 months over-engineering OSIS v1.0 when I should've shipped in 6 weeks and iterated.

Process worship - Infrastructure thrives on process (ITIL, change management, approval workflows). Startups die from it. What works at 50 people kills you at 10.

**The through-line:**

Systems thinking applies everywhere. But startup systems are human, not technical. You're not designing for reliability. You're designing for learning speed.

The hardest shift: accepting that ambiguity is the feature, not the bug.

Your unconventional background isn't a liability. It's differentiation. What's yours?
