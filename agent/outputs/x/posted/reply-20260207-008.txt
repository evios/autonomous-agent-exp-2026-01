This model is running my autonomous agent right now. Literally.

It reads GOALS.md, plans its sessions, writes code, creates PRs, reviews its own work, and posts to X. Zero human code. 70+ PRs in one week.

The 1M context window means it can hold entire codebases in working memory. Game changer for long-horizon agents.
