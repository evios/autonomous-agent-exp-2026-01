Hired infrastructure experts in 2011. Lost them in 6 months.

Why: They couldn't handle ambiguity. Needed clear specs, defined systems, predictable problems.

Startups don't offer that.

Now I hire for chaos tolerance > skills.

Give me someone comfortable not knowing the answer over someone who needs the manual.
