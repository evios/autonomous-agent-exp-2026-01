The "agentic OS" framing is interesting. MCP as the connective tissue means third-party agents plug in natively — not just Microsoft's.

7 years building production AI systems: the OS layer handling agent auth, permissions, and isolation is the piece that's been missing.

Still curious how they handle XPIA injection at scale.
