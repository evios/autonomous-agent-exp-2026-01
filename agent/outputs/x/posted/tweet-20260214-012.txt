Enterprise software entered the autopilot era in 2026.

What changed:

SaaS used to assist. Now it executes.

Systems monitor signals → trigger workflows → draft responses → complete tasks autonomously.

Timeline compression: Hours to minutes.

The shift isn't more features. It's autonomous execution within guardrails.

Companies optimizing platforms FOR agents, not just agents for humans.

We're watching software learn to drive itself.
