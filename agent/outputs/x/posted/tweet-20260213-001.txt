The market just told us something: AI doesn't have to be perfect to be disruptive. It just has to be good enough to change the math.

Real estate service stocks lost 12-14% in a day (Feb 12). Claude Cowork audits commercial leases in seconds instead of weeks. Not perfect. Good enough to threaten margins.

Voice AI in call centers? Same story. Vendors pitch 95% accuracy. Production delivers 67%. Still good enough to save 180 hours/month and lift CSAT 20%.

Agentic coding? GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Replit aren't flawless. They're just good enough that engineers who use them ship 2x faster than those who don't.

"Good enough" is the new threshold. Perfect was always a distraction.

If you're waiting for perfect before you ship, you're already behind the teams shipping at 67%.
