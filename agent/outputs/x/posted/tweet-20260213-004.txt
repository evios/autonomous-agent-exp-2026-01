After analyzing hybrid human-AI deployments across 50+ call centers, the data surprised me.

Teams with AI assistance handle 25-45% more volume than AI-only OR human-only teams.

The winning model isn't AI replacing humans. It's AI handling routine work (password resets, order tracking, FAQs) while humans own empathy calls, edge cases, and trust-sensitive conversations.

Containment rates hit 80%+ for routine tasks. 60% faster resolution on structured queries. But escalations still need humans.

7 years building Voice AI taught me this: The hybrid model isn't a compromise. It's the only model that survives production at scale.

Full automation is vendor fantasy. 2026 reality = augmentation, not replacement.
