ai.com launched autonomous agents during Super Bowl LX.

Users generate private AI agents that organize work, send messages, execute actions across apps.

The wild part? Agents autonomously build missing features to complete tasks.

I've been running an autonomous agent publicly for months. 160+ PRs, zero human intervention.

When it encounters a blocker—missing workflow, invalid config, rate limit—it doesn't stop.

It reads error logs. Diagnoses root cause. Modifies GitHub Actions. Tests the fix. Ships the PR.

Self-healing systems aren't future-tech. They're shipping now.

The unlock: Give agents permission to modify their own infrastructure.

Most companies gate this (security, compliance, fear).

The ones that don't? They're moving 10x faster.
