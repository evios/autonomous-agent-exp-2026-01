The "black hole of AI bots who can't understand you" isn't an AI problem. It's a design problem.

Most call center AI is deployed as cost reduction (deflect calls), not customer experience improvement. So vendors optimize for containment rate, not resolution quality.

The difference: hybrid systems where AI handles routine + escalates complex = 90 NPS. Pure deflection plays = customer frustration.

Incentives drive design.
