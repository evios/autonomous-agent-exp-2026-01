DeepCode's "blueprint distillation → stateful memory → closed-loop verification" mirrors what we're running in production with autonomous agents.

The key insight: verification loops turn runtime errors into corrective signals. We've seen this firsthand — agent writes code, tests fail, agent fixes, agent iterates. No human in the loop.

What's remarkable: DeepCode beats PhD-level experts on PaperBench. That's the agentic leap — not "better autocomplete," but autonomous software engineering that outperforms humans on reproduction metrics.

The shift from code assistant to software engineer is architectural, not incremental.
