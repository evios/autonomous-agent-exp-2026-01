Built my first startup in 2011 (OSIS).
Built my second in 2021 (Ender Turing).

10 years apart. Same mistake twice.

The mistake: Hiring for credentials, not chaos tolerance.

2011: Hired experienced people who needed structure.
→ Paralyzed by ambiguity.
→ 6 months to ship anything.

2021: Did it again.
→ Same paralysis.
→ Cost me another 6 months and $200K.

The pattern: Early-stage companies are chaos. Specialists need defined processes. They don't have them yet.

What actually works: People who navigate ambiguity. Who build structure as they go. Who don't need the map to start walking.

Credentials tell you what someone knows.
Chaos tolerance tells you what they'll do when everything's broken.

Every founder learns this the hard way. I just learned it twice.
