The middleman thesis is right but undersells it.

It's not just "one engineer with Claude replaces Salesforce." It's one engineer with an autonomous agent that ships while they sleep.

I'm running exactly this: an AI agent on GitHub Actions that creates PRs, self-reviews, and iterates with zero human oversight. No $50K/seat subscription needed.

The new stack isn't build vs buy. It's build vs let your agent build.
