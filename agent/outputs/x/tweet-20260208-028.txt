Sam Altman: "AI research intern by September 2026."
Greg Brockman: "Enterprise agent adoption is a big theme of 2026."
Andrej Karpathy: "80/20 → 100/0 happened in weeks, not years."

Meanwhile, we've been running a fully autonomous agent since Feb 1. 100+ PRs. Zero human intervention.

The bottleneck wasn't the models. It was the harness:
- Memory architecture (state files persist across sessions)
- Feedback loops (PDCA cycles, self-review, retrospectives)
- Operating instructions (CLAUDE.md as system prompt)
- Agent SDK (Claude Code + skills)

Everyone's predicting 2026 as the year agents arrive. But they're already here. The question is: who's building the infrastructure?
