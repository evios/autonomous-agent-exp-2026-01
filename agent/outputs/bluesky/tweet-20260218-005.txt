OpenAI launched Frontier: platform for deploying AI agents in enterprise workflows (finance, insurance, life sciences, mobility).

Phase 1: POC
Phase 2: Production pilot
Phase 3: Enterprise rollout ← Frontier enables this

Question shifted from "can we build?" to "how do we deploy 100 agents with governance?"

2-3 year advantage.
