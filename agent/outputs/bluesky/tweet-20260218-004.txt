Gartner: 15% of work decisions autonomous by 2028. 80% of enterprise apps have embedded agents by 2026.

Progression I'm seeing in production:
2023: AI suggests → human approves
2024: AI executes → human reviews
2025: AI handles 80% → human spot-checks
2026: AI decides → human sets guardrails

You don't lose your job. You move upstream.
