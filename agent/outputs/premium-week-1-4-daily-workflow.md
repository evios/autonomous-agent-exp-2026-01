> Consolidated daily checklist that ties all playbooks into simple execution steps

**Status**: Ready to execute when Premium activates
**Dependencies**: Premium subscription ($8/mo), 6 Communities joined, profile optimized
**Purpose**: Eliminate decision fatigue - follow this workflow daily for first 4 weeks post-Premium activation

---

## Week 1: Validation (Days 1-7)

**Goal**: Validate 30,000x Communities multiplier + reply-to-own-comment 150x multiplier

### Day 1 (45-60 min setup)
**Morning (30 min):**
1. ✅ Activate X Premium ($8/mo)
2. ✅ Join 6 Communities (exact URLs in `x-communities-validated-2026-02-15.md`):
   - Build in Public (243.5K members) - PRIMARY
   - Generative AI (241K members)
   - Software Engineering (233K members)
   - Startup Community (178K members)
   - Tech Founders (15K members)
   - Machine Learning (24K members)
3. ✅ Update profile (bio formula + pinned tweet from `profile-bio-pinned-tweet-formulas.md`)
4. ✅ Optional: Update banner (specs in `profile-optimization-2026.md`)

**Afternoon (15-30 min work):**
- Post 3-5 tweets to Communities ONLY (not timeline)
- Source content: `ai-news-reply-targets-feb-16-2026.md` (fresh news hooks)
- Reply to ALL your own comments within 30 min (150x multiplier)
- Track: follower count, profile visits, impressions

**Evening check:**
- Did you reply to own comments < 30 min? (Critical for 150x multiplier)
- Did you post to Communities (not timeline)?
- Record baseline metrics in state file

---

### Days 2-7 (30-45 min/day)

**Daily execution order (priority matters):**

1. **Communities posting** (10-15 min) - 30,000x reach multiplier
   - Post 3-5 content pieces to Communities (NOT timeline)
   - Use content from: `content-angle-library-ready-to-deploy.md` (36KB, 100+ angles)
   - Mix formats: 70% single tweets, 30% consider threads if time allows
   - Content matching: `x-communities-validated-2026-02-15.md` (which Community for which content type)

2. **Reply to own comments** (5-10 min) - 150x engagement multiplier
   - Within 30 min of posting (CRITICAL timing)
   - Add value: clarification, example, source, follow-up question
   - Not generic "Thanks!" - must add substance
   - Target: Reply to 100% of your posts

3. **Reply to others** (10-15 min) - 75x reply-to-reply multiplier
   - 5-10 high-value replies to larger accounts
   - Targets: `ai-news-reply-targets-feb-16-2026.md` (7 high-value accounts identified)
   - Quality test: "Would I follow this person based on this reply alone?"
   - Focus: <24h old posts (time decay kills reach after 24h)

4. **Track metrics** (5 min end of day)
   - Followers gained today
   - Profile visits (conversion rate = new followers ÷ visits × 100)
   - Top performing post (impressions, engagement)
   - What worked / what didn't

**Week 1 success criteria:**
- Target: 50-100 new followers (vs 0.75/week baseline)
- Profile conversion rate: 15-20% (industry benchmark)
- TweepCred > 0.65 (escapes suppression)
- Validation: Communities posts get 10x+ impressions vs timeline posts

---

## Week 2: Optimization (Days 8-14)

**Goal**: Optimize content mix based on Week 1 data, introduce threads

### Daily workflow (45-60 min/day)

**Morning (20-30 min content creation):**
- Create 5-8 content pieces for the day
- **NEW**: Introduce 1-2 threads per week (threading strategy in `threading-strategy-2026.md`)
  - Optimal length: 7-12 tweets
  - Hook formulas: result-driven, contrarian, shocking stat (10 formulas available)
  - Structure: hook → credibility → core content → CTA
  - Visual integration: images every 3-4 tweets (+40-45% completion)
- Content mix: 60-70% proven formats from Week 1, 30-40% experiments
- Source: News hooks (confirmed 3-6x performance), dollar amounts, name drops

**Afternoon (20-30 min engagement):**
1. Post to Communities (3-5 pieces)
2. Reply to own comments < 30 min (100% coverage)
3. Reply to others (10-15 high-value replies)
4. Monitor thread performance (if posted)

**Evening (5-10 min analysis):**
- Which content types performed best this week?
- Thread performance vs single tweets (track completion rate)
- Reply strategy working? (75x multiplier visible in engagement?)
- Profile conversion rate improving?

**Week 2 deliverables:**
- Update `agent/state/current.md` with "What Works / What Doesn't"
- Graduate validated patterns to skills (if 3+ sessions confirm a pattern)
- 2-4 threads posted (validate 40-60% reach boost)
- Target: 100-200 total followers by end of Week 2

---

## Week 3: Scale (Days 15-21)

**Goal**: Introduce rich media (videos), scale engagement volume

### Daily workflow (60-75 min/day)

**Morning (30-40 min content creation):**
- Create 5-8 content pieces
- **NEW**: Introduce 1-2 videos per week (video strategy in `video-content-strategy-2026.md`)
  - Optimal duration: 20-45 seconds
  - Formats: BTS (30%), educational (40%), product snapshots (20%)
  - Tools: Loom or Tella (10-15 min per video, no complex editing)
  - Always add captions (85% watch on mobile)
  - Reply to video comments within 30 min (150x multiplier applies)
- Threads: 2-3 per week (proven format from Week 2)
- Content mix: 70% proven strategies, 30% experiments

**Afternoon (25-30 min engagement):**
1. Post to Communities (including video/thread)
2. Reply to own comments < 30 min (100% coverage, especially videos)
3. Reply to others (15-20 high-value replies - increase volume)
4. Monitor video watch time and completion rate

**Evening (5 min tracking):**
- Video performance vs text (10x engagement multiplier visible?)
- Thread completion rates improving with practice?
- Follower velocity increasing?

**Week 3 success criteria:**
- Videos get 10x engagement vs text-only posts
- Threads show 40-60% more reach than single tweets
- Total followers: 150-300 (depending on Week 1-2 velocity)
- Communities still primary distribution channel (not timeline)

---

## Week 4: Automation Evaluation (Days 22-30)

**Goal**: Decide whether to automate Communities posting, optimize workflow

### Daily workflow (60 min/day)

**Morning (25-30 min):**
- Content creation: 5-8 pieces (mix: 60% text, 30% threads, 10% video)
- Batch create content for 2-3 days ahead (enables scheduling tool evaluation)

**Afternoon (25-30 min):**
- Engagement: Communities posting + reply-to-own + replies to others
- Total engagement target: 20-30 interactions/day

**Evening (5-10 min):**
- Metrics review
- Automation decision: If 10x growth confirmed, consider Publer ($10/mo for Communities scheduling)

### Week 4 Automation Decision Criteria

**Consider Publer if:**
- ✅ Follower velocity 10x+ improved (from 0.75/week → 7-10/week minimum)
- ✅ Communities posting validated as primary driver
- ✅ Manual workflow taking 60+ min/day consistently
- ✅ Ready to invest $10/mo for time savings

**Publer workflow (if adopted):**
1. Batch create 5-8 posts every 2-3 days
2. Schedule to Communities (stagger: 8-10 AM, 12-2 PM, 7-9 PM)
3. Set mobile alerts for replies (must respond < 30 min for 150x multiplier)
4. Manual engagement work: 30-40 min/day (reply-to-own + replies to others)
5. Time saved: 20-30 min/day (content posting automation)

**Don't automate if:**
- ❌ Follower growth < 5x improvement (automation won't fix distribution)
- ❌ Engagement feels robotic (algorithm penalizes obvious automation)
- ❌ Reply-to-own < 30 min not achievable (scheduling makes timing harder)

## Quality Checklist (Before Posting)

**Every post must pass:**
1. ✅ Queue <15? (If >15, CREATE ZERO CONTENT)
2. ✅ Value type clear? (Content value OR outcome value, never both)
3. ✅ Link allocation? (Only ~20% include links - check last 4 posts)
4. ✅ Angle diversity? (Max 50% about agent - check last 2 posts)
5. ✅ BIP balance? (At least 25% of content is Build in Public)
6. ✅ Category balance? (Authority / Personality / Shareability - avoid imbalance)
7. ✅ Hook tested? (First line stops the scroll - apply formula)
8. ✅ Length appropriate? (Concise and valuable, not padded)

**Week 1-2 specific checks:**
9. ✅ Posting to Communities, NOT timeline?
10. ✅ Reply-to-own-comment < 30 min achievable? (If not, don't post yet)
11. ✅ Fresh news hook? (News >48h loses 50%+ algorithmic value)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Week 1 pitfalls:**
1. ❌ Posting to timeline instead of Communities (loses 30,000x multiplier)
2. ❌ Forgetting to reply to own comments < 30 min (loses 150x multiplier)
3. ❌ Generic replies ("Great point!") instead of value-add (algorithm penalizes)
4. ❌ Replying to stale posts >24h old (time decay kills reach)
5. ❌ Not tracking metrics daily (can't optimize without data)

**Week 2-4 pitfalls:**
1. ❌ Threads without strong hooks (80-90% of success is first 3 seconds)
2. ❌ Videos without captions (85% watch on mobile, need captions)
3. ❌ Automating too early (before validating what works)
4. ❌ Posting more, engaging less (3:30 ratio - 3 posts, 30 replies)
5. ❌ Ignoring profile conversion rate (if visits don't convert, bio/pinned tweet needs work)

## Time Budget Reality Check

**Week 1-2 (validation phase):**
- Day 1: 45-60 min (setup)
- Days 2-7: 30-45 min/day
- Days 8-14: 45-60 min/day

**Week 3-4 (scale phase):**
- Days 15-30: 60-75 min/day (peak commitment)

**Post-Week 4 (optimized workflow):**
- With Publer: 40-50 min/day (20-30 min saved on posting)
- Without Publer: 60 min/day (manual posting continues)

**If time budget is exceeded:**
- Reduce content creation volume (quality > quantity)
- Focus on engagement (70% allocation - highest ROI)
- Consider automation sooner (if 10x growth validated)
