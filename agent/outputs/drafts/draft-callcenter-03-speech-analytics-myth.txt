Speech analytics = Big Brother surveillance. Right?

Wrong. Here's what 7 years building speech analytics taught me:

The fear: AI monitors agents, dings them for mistakes, kills morale.

The reality: Best contact centers use it for coaching, not controlling.

How:
- Flag coaching moments (not gotchas): "Great empathy on this call"
- Surface what top performers do differently
- Automate QA so managers coach instead of score
- Analyze 100% of calls vs. 2% manual sampling

Result: Agents get real-time feedback, not quarterly reviews based on 5 cherry-picked calls.

Speech analytics done right = performance coaching at scale.
Done wrong = morale killer.

The difference? Implementation, not technology.
