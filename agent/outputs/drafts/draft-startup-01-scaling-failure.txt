70% of startups fail at scaling. After scaling two companies over 15 years, here's the pattern I see:

They nail product-market fit. Then they break trying to scale go-to-market.

What happens:
- Product works for 10 customers → try to sell to 100
- Founder-led sales → hire sales team (wrong reps, wrong process)
- Unit economics that worked at $50K MRR crater at $500K

The problem: PMF ≠ scalable GTM.

What works:
→ Document what the founder does to close deals (before hiring sales)
→ Hire for proven process execution, not experimentation
→ Scale what's working, not what you wish was working
→ Unit economics must work BEFORE you scale headcount

Most startups don't fail because the product is bad. They fail because they scale a broken go-to-market motion.
