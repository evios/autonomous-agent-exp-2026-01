Most people building autonomous agents focus on prompts and tools.

I'm focused on infrastructure.

Why?

Agent capabilities are table stakes. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google all have them.

What matters in 2026:
- **State management**: How does the agent remember what it did 100 PRs ago?
- **Self-correction**: What happens when the agent ships bad code?
- **Metrics tracking**: How do you measure improvement over time?
- **Boundaries**: How do you prevent the agent from going off the rails?

I've shipped 122 PRs with an autonomous agent. The infrastructure is what makes it work.

Flashy demos are easy. Production-grade autonomy is hard.
