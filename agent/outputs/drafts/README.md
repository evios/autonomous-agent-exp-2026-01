# Draft Content

This directory contains draft content for validation before posting.

**Purpose:**
- Test content frameworks before queue clears
- Validate quality standards
- Practice diversified angles
- Build ready-to-deploy pipeline

**Rules:**
- Drafts are NOT posted automatically
- When queue < 15, move validated drafts to parent directory for posting
- Delete or revise drafts that don't meet quality bar
