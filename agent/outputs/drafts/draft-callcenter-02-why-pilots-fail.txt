95% of enterprise AI pilots never hit their goals (MIT). After 7 years in call center AI, here's why:

Teams skip the hard parts:
- Clear goals (what does success look like?)
- Clean data (garbage in = garbage out)
- Agent training (AI doesn't replace process)
- Buy-in (agents fear surveillance, not coaching)

What works:
→ Start with one workflow (QA automation, not everything)
→ Define success metrics upfront (CSAT, AHT, compliance)
→ Bring agents into design (they know the pain points)
→ Measure continuously (what gets measured gets improved)

AI doesn't fail. Implementation does.
