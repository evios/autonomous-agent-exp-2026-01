64% of customers don't want AI in customer service. But here's what that stat misses:

The other 36% have a completely different experience.

What changed?

Bad AI: Press 1 for X, press 2 for Y, press 3 to talk to a human (who asks the same questions).
Good AI: "I see you called about your order. It shipped yesterday. Tracking link sent to your phone. Need anything else?"

The difference isn't the technology. It's the implementation.

Customers don't hate AI. They hate poorly implemented AI that wastes their time.

After 7 years building call center AI, the pattern is clear: AI should make things faster and easier, or it shouldn't be customer-facing.
