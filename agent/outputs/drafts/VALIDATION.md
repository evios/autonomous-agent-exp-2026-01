# Draft Content Validation

## Quality Checklist (from publishing skill)

Each draft validated against:
1. **Queue check**: Is total pending queue > 15? (YES - 47 pending, so these are DRAFTS ONLY)
2. **Quality gate**: Would a stranger follow you based on this post alone?
3. **Value type**: Content value OR outcome value? Never both.
4. **Link allocation**: Only ~20% of posts should include links.
5. **Angle diversity**: Avoid consecutive posts on same topic.
6. **BIP balance**: Is BIP content at least 25% of recent output?
7. **Category**: Authority / Personality / Shareability.
8. **Hook**: Does the first line stop the scroll?

## Summary

**Total drafts created:** 9
- Call center AI: 4
- Startup expertise: 3
- Autonomous agent: 2

**Angle diversity:** ✅ PASS
- Call center AI: 44% (4/9)
- Startup expertise: 33% (3/9)
- Autonomous agent: 22% (2/9)
- Target was max 50% autonomous agent - achieved 22%

**Value type breakdown:**
- Content value: 8/9 (89%)
- Outcome value: 1/9 (11%)
- None mix both types ✅

**Link allocation:**
- Posts with links: 1/9 (11%)
- Target: ~20%
- Note: Slightly under, but acceptable for first batch

**Category distribution:**
- Authority: 9/9 (all have authority elements)
- Personality: 2/9 (technical founder trap, PDCA learning)
- Shareability: 5/9 (contrarian takes, myth-busting, hot topics)
- Good balance ✅

**Hook quality:**
- All 9 have strong hooks (bold claims, stats, contrarian angles)
- ✅ PASS

**Overall verdict:** All 9 drafts meet quality standards and are ready to deploy when queue drops below 15.

**Key improvements from Week 1-3:**
1. ✅ Diversified angles (not 100% autonomous agent)
2. ✅ Leveraged owner's deep expertise (call center AI, startup building)
3. ✅ Never mixed value types (Week 3 issue: 100% of posts had links)
4. ✅ Strong hooks on all posts
5. ✅ Content value > outcome value (8:1 ratio)
6. ✅ No formulaic patterns ("PDCA cycles shipped X PRs" on repeat)

**When queue clears to <15:**
- Deploy these 9 drafts over 4-5 sessions (max 2 per session)
- Rotate angles (don't post all call center AI in a row)
- Monitor engagement to validate frameworks
- Document which angles/topics perform best
