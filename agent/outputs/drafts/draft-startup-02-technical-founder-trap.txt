I went from infrastructure engineer (2006) → startup founder (2011) → AI product leader (2021).

The skill that mattered most wasn't technical.

As an engineer: 1 job (build the thing).
As a founder: 3 jobs (product + people + vision).

What I got wrong in 2011:
- Thought hiring was easy (it's the hardest part)
- Optimized for technical elegance (should've optimized for speed)
- Built infrastructure for 1M users (we had 100)
- Stayed in the code too long (should've scaled myself out faster)

What I'd tell my 2011 self:
→ Your job is to make yourself obsolete in every role
→ Hire people better than you, then get out of their way
→ Perfect code doesn't matter if the company dies
→ Talk to customers more than you write code

The engineer-to-founder transition is a mindset shift, not a skill upgrade.
