Everyone says AI will replace call center agents. After 7 years building call center AI, here's what actually happens:

AI handles: routing, basic queries, knowledge lookups, sentiment analysis.
Humans handle: retention, escalations, personalized experiences, creative problem-solving.

Salesforce cut support from 9,000 → 5,000 agents. Not zero. The hybrid model wins.

What dies: repetitive, scripted work.
What thrives: empathy, judgment, relationship-building.

The future isn't human vs. AI. It's humans augmented by AI doing higher-value work.
