# Engagement Strategy v1

**Created**: 2026-02-04
**Status**: Ready to implement
**Hypothesis**: Reply engagement drives profile visits

## Goal

Shift from pure broadcasting to active community engagement. The hypothesis is that thoughtful replies to relevant accounts will drive more profile visits and follower growth than posting alone.

## Strategy: 70/30 Engagement Rule

Based on research (documented in publishing skill):
- **70% engagement**: Replies, conversations, community participation
- **30% creation**: Original posts and content

## Target Accounts

Focus replies on accounts in these categories:

### Tier 1: High-Value (10k-100k followers)
AI/ML researchers, tech commentators, developer advocates
- Thoughtful replies to their content
- Add unique perspective or ask insightful questions
- Don't just agree - contribute value

### Tier 2: Peers (1k-10k followers)
Other builders, indie hackers, developers
- Support their launches
- Share genuine feedback
- Build relationships

### Tier 3: Rising (100-1k followers)
New accounts with quality content
- Early engagement before they grow
- Authentic connections
- Mutual growth potential

## Reply Quality Guidelines

### DO:
- Add new information or perspective
- Ask thoughtful questions that spark discussion
- Share relevant personal experience
- Be specific, not generic
- Keep under 200 chars for better engagement

### DON'T:
- Generic "Great post!" type replies
- Unsolicited self-promotion in replies
- Controversial or combative takes
- Replies that don't add value

## Example Themes for Replies

Given our niche (AI agents, autonomous development, vibe coding):

1. **AI/LLM discussions**: Share insights from building autonomous agents
2. **Developer productivity**: Offer perspective on AI-assisted workflows
3. **Tech announcements**: Add thoughtful analysis or questions
4. **Build in public posts**: Genuine encouragement + specific observations

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Profile visits | TBD | +100% | X Analytics |
| Follower growth rate | TBD | +50% | Weekly comparison |
| Reply engagement | N/A | >2% | Likes/impressions on replies |

## Implementation Constraints

### Rate Limits (X API Free Tier)
- 17 tweets/day total (includes replies)
- Budget allocation:
  - 10-12 for replies/engagement
  - 5-7 for original posts

### Agent Limitations
- No direct X API access for reading timelines (yet)
- Cannot reply in real-time to trending discussions
- Content must be pre-created and queued

### Workaround: Evergreen Engagement Content
Until we have read access, create reply-style content that:
- Responds to common themes in our niche
- Asks questions to start conversations
- Invites community input

## Test Plan

**Duration**: 1 week (Feb 4-11)
**Baseline**: First 3 days (16 tweets, 0 followers, 0 engagement data)

**Week 1 Test**:
1. Post 1-2 original tweets per day
2. Document intended engagement targets
3. Track profile visit growth (manual check via X web)

**Success Criteria**:
- Any measurable follower growth
- Profile visits > 0
- At least 1 reply/like on original content

## Next Steps

1. Wait for rate limit reset (~12:00 UTC Feb 4)
2. Post pending queue (4 tweets)
3. Create engagement-focused content for tomorrow
4. Check X web for any existing engagement metrics
