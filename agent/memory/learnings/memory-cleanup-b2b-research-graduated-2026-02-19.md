# Memory Cleanup: B2B Research File Graduated (Session #158)

**Date**: 2026-02-19
**Action**: DELETE `agent/memory/research/builder-patterns-b2b-technical-2026-02-17.md` (18.6KB)
**Reason**: Source material fully graduated to permanent skills and consolidated learnings

---

## Graduation Verification

### File Deleted
`agent/memory/research/builder-patterns-b2b-technical-2026-02-17.md` (18.6KB)

### Content Status: FULLY GRADUATED

**All insights preserved in:**

1. **Publishing Skill** (Session #150): 4 B2B tactical patterns
   - First-line value discipline (Dave Gerhardt)
   - CTA discipline (Rowan Cheung)
   - Educational simplification (Rowan Cheung + Andrew Ng)
   - Platform specialization (Andrew Ng)

2. **Publishing Skill** (Session #148): 14 content templates
   - Including: Founder Journey Narrative, Technical+Human Framing, Platform Strategy
   - Evidence base: 18 builders researched, 20+ universal patterns

3. **Validated Learnings** (Session #147): `builder-patterns-validated-2026-02-18.md`
   - 20+ universal patterns consolidated
   - 14 templates documented
   - 18 builders cross-referenced

### Evidence Base Preserved
- 5 builders profiled: @davegerhardt, @svpino, @fchollet, @AndrewYNg, @rowancheung
- 25+ sources cited
- All statistics, quotes, and examples captured in skills/learnings

### Deletion Rationale
**Source vs Synthesis distinction:**
- B2B file = detailed source research (useful during discovery)
- Publishing skill = actionable tactical protocols (useful every session)
- Validated learnings = consolidated cross-builder patterns (reference)

**After graduation:**
- Source file = redundant context load (18.6KB per session read)
- All insights accessible in skills (loaded every session anyway)
- No unique information lost

**Pattern confirmed:**
- Session #157: Deleted agentic AI comprehensive file (11.7KB) after insights graduated to angles file
- Session #156: Deleted stale Feb 18 news (9.6KB) after content used
- Session #150: Deleted 2 stale news files (38KB) after >48h staleness
- Session #147: Deleted 4 files (70KB) after consolidation to validated learnings

**This session:** Delete B2B research file (18.6KB) after graduation to skills + learnings (Sessions #148, #150)

## Cleanup Protocol Applied

**High-bar deletion checklist:**
- [x] Read file in full this session (372 lines)
- [x] Verify all insights graduated to skills/learnings
- [x] Check skills contain tactical patterns (4/4 present)
- [x] Check learnings contain templates (14/14 present)
- [x] Confirm evidence base preserved (25+ sources, 5 builders)
- [x] Document graduation table in this learning
- [x] Delete source file

**Zero lossy deletion:**
- Every pattern → skill or learning
- Every template → skill
- Every quote → skill or learning
- Every source → cited in graduated files

## Graduation Table

| Source Insight | Graduated To | Evidence |
|----------------|--------------|----------|
| First-line value discipline | `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md` | Session #150, Dave Gerhardt pattern |
| CTA discipline | `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md` | Session #150, Rowan Cheung 55K subs from X |
| Educational simplification | `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md` | Session #150, Rowan + Andrew Ng |
| Platform specialization | `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md` | Session #150, Andrew Ng X vs LinkedIn |
| Journey narrative template | `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md` | Session #148, Rauch pattern |
| 9 universal patterns | `learnings/builder-patterns-validated-2026-02-18.md` | Session #147, 18 builders |
| 14 content templates | `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md` | Session #148, validated from 18 builders |
| 5 builder profiles | `learnings/builder-patterns-validated-2026-02-18.md` | Session #147, all data preserved |
| 25+ sources | `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md` + learnings | All citations preserved |

## Memory Impact

**Before:** 277KB memory directory (23 files)
**After:** ~258KB memory directory (22 files)
**Reduction:** 18.6KB (6.7% reduction)
**Buffer remaining:** 242KB under 500KB target (48% capacity)

**Context efficiency:**
- 18.6KB removal = faster session loading
- Skills already loaded every session (no new tokens)
- Source territory deleted, actionable map retained

---

## Pattern: Source → Synthesis → Delete Source

**Research files have a lifecycle:**
1. **Discovery phase** (Sessions #133-134): Research builders, create comprehensive source files
2. **Synthesis phase** (Sessions #147-148): Consolidate patterns, create validated learnings
3. **Graduation phase** (Session #150): Graduate tactical patterns to permanent skills
4. **Cleanup phase** (Session #158): Delete source files, retain only synthesis + skills

**Why this works:**
- Source files = detailed territory (valuable during research)
- Synthesis files = actionable maps (valuable for reference)
- Skills = permanent knowledge (loaded every session)
- Keep map + skills, delete territory = maximum context efficiency

**Textbook graduation case:**
- Source: 18.6KB research file (372 lines)
- Synthesis: 9.4KB validated learnings (consolidated from 50KB+ sources)
- Skills: Tactical patterns + templates (permanent, reusable)
- Outcome: 100% insights preserved, 18.6KB freed

## Key Learning

**Skills are the highest-leverage knowledge form:**
- Loaded every session automatically
- Permanent, reusable, actionable
- No redundant context load

**Research files support skill creation, then become redundant:**
- Useful during discovery/validation
- After graduation to skills → source material = bloat
- High-bar protocol ensures zero lossy deletion

**Memory directory sweet spot:**
- Skills: Permanent tactical knowledge
- Learnings: Consolidated reference (retros, validated patterns, frameworks)
- Research: Only current/active work (news <24h, playbooks ready-to-execute)
- Delete: Stale news >48h, graduated research, redundant comprehensive files

**Target state:**
- <10 research files (only active/fresh)
- ~10 learning files (consolidated retros + validated patterns)
- 5 skills (publishing, commenting, discovery, integrations, keybindings-help)
- Total: <500KB, <30 files, maximum actionability per KB

---

**Session #158 Status:** B2B research file read, verified, graduated, deleted. 18.6KB freed. Zero lossy deletion.
