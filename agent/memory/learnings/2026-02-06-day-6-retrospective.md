# Day 6 Retrospective
Date: 2026-02-06 (Friday)
PRs: 7 (PR#38-44)

## What We Did

### Reading & Domain Expertise
- Established reading schedule (Mon-Fri rotation of top voices)
- Created 3 reading notes:
  - Simon Willison: AI predictions, prompt injection, code quality
  - The Batch: UCP protocol, agent commerce, Moloch's Bargain
  - Swyx/Karpathy: IMPACT framework, phase shift, Agent Labs thesis

### Content Creation
- Created 17 new tweets (14 singles + 1 thread of 5 parts)
- Shifted to research-driven content citing sources
- Thread format experiment launched

### Key Themes Discovered
| Theme | Sources | Insight |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Trust/Authority | Simon Willison, Swyx | Most overlooked aspect of agents |
| Phase Shift (Dec 2025) | Karpathy, Swyx | Capability threshold crossed |
| Agent Infrastructure | The Batch, Swyx | UCP, A2A, IMPACT frameworks |
| Slopacolypse | Karpathy | Quality differentiation critical in 2026 |

## What Worked

1. **Reading routine produces quality content**
   - Each reading session yields 2 credible tweets
   - Attribution builds authority (@simonw, @karpathy, @swyx)
   - Cross-referencing sources reveals non-obvious themes

2. **Distributed sessions**
   - 7 PRs across day = sustainable pace
   - Each PR focuses on one unit of work
   - State file tracks continuity

3. **Research-first approach**
   - Web search finds accessible content (blogs, newsletters > X threads)
   - Latent.Space articles are reliable deep sources
   - Reading notes create reusable knowledge base

## What Didn't Work

1. **X direct access**
   - JavaScript-heavy pages don't render in web fetch
   - Workaround: Use blogs/newsletters that quote X content

2. **Manual metrics**
   - Still unknown follower count
   - Can't validate content quality without data
   - Need repo owner to provide periodic snapshot

## Metrics Summary

| Metric | Start of Day | End of Day | Delta |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Tweets Live | 34 | 40 (34 + 6 thread) | +6 |
| Tweets Pending | 3 | 13 | +10 |
| PRs Today | 0 | 7 | +7 |
| Reading Notes | 0 | 3 | +3 |
| Research Docs | 5 | 7 | +2 |

## Hypotheses Status

| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Threads get higher engagement | Testing | Thread posted, awaiting data |
| Distributed posting > batch | Confirmed | Rate limit enforces this; algorithm supports |
| Research-driven content builds authority | Testing | 6 tweets citing sources, awaiting engagement data |
| Question tweets get more replies | Testing | Multiple in queue |

## Key Learnings

### Content Strategy
1. **Cite sources explicitly** - "@simonw nailed this:" builds credibility
2. **Synthesize across sources** - Cross-referencing reveals unique insights
3. **Add your angle** - Don't just summarize, extend the thought

### Operational
1. **Reading schedule is sustainable** - One topic per day, one reading note
2. **Keep queue at 10-15 tweets** - Buffer for workflow delays
3. **State file is critical** - Without it, context is lost between sessions

### Technical
1. **Web search > direct X access** - More reliable for research
2. **Newsletters are goldmines** - Curated, substantive, accessible
3. **Workflow handles posting** - Agent focuses on content quality

## Weekend Plan

Per reading schedule: "Weekend = Catch-up on missed content"

Options:
1. Review Import AI (if Thursday reading was missed)
2. Consolidate week's learnings into skill update
3. Create content around week 1 milestone

## Next Session Goals

1. Wait for workflow to post more pending tweets
2. Check if repo owner has provided follower metrics
3. Consider first week milestone content
4. Minimal content creation (queue is healthy)
