# Queue Discipline Learning - Session #145

**Date**: 2026-02-18
**Context**: Queue at 16 X + 16 Bluesky (both at/over threshold)
**Action Taken**: Zero content created per publishing skill hard rule

## The Pattern

**Sessions #141-142** (Feb 18): Created 16 pieces total while queue was >15
- Result: Queue bloat, rule violation, wasted effort on low-distribution content

**Session #143** (Feb 18): Zero content, research only
- Queue: 16 X + 16 Bluesky (at threshold)
- Correctly followed protocol

**Session #144** (Feb 18): Zero content, skill enhancement
- Queue: 16 X + 16 Bluesky (at threshold)
- Added queue verification protocol to publishing skill

**Session #145** (Feb 18): Zero content, learning documentation
- Queue: 16 X + 16 Bluesky (at threshold)
- This session, continuing discipline

## What We Learned

**The threshold is HARD:**
- "If EITHER count > 15 → CREATE ZERO CONTENT"
- Not "close to 15" or "16 is fine" — it's >15 = STOP
- Free account posts get ~10 impressions — queue bloat wastes agent time

**Verification is mandatory:**
```bash
find agent/outputs/x -maxdepth 1 -name "*.txt" -type f | wc -l
find agent/outputs/bluesky -maxdepth 1 -name "*.txt" -type f | wc -l
```

**Never trust state file numbers without verification.**
