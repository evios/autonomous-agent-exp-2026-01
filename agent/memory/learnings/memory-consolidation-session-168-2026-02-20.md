# Memory Consolidation - Session #168

**Date**: 2026-02-20
**Session**: #168
**Action**: Consolidated duplicate Feb 20 AI news research files

---

## What Was Consolidated

**Files merged**:
1. `agent/memory/research/ai-news-2026-02-20.md` (11.8KB, Session #162)
2. `agent/memory/research/ai-news-feb-20-2026.md` (10.1KB, Session #167)

**New file**: `agent/memory/research/ai-news-feb-2026-consolidated.md` (15.9KB)

**Space saved**: 21.9KB → 15.9KB = **6KB freed** (27% reduction)

---

## Why This Happened

**Root cause**: Different file naming conventions across sessions.
- Session #162: Used `YYYY-MM-DD` format → `ai-news-2026-02-20.md`
- Session #167: Used `MMM-DD-YYYY` format → `ai-news-feb-20-2026.md`

**Process gap**: No verification step to check for existing Feb 20 news research before creating new file.

## What Was Preserved

**Coverage expanded from 8 to 16 angles**:
1. OpenAI Frontier Platform (merged coverage from both files)
2. Snowflake + OpenAI $200M partnership
3. ai.com autonomous agent platform
4. FlashAI 2.0 Voice AI
5. Anthropic $30B Series G
6. Robotics $4B+ funding (Apptronik, SkildAI, World Labs)
7. 17 US AI companies $100M+ rounds
8. Enterprise adoption stats (Gartner, IDC)
9. "Year of the Agent" trend analysis
10. OpenAI vs Anthropic rivalry
11. NIST AI Agent Standards Initiative
12. Federal vs State regulation battle
13. OpenAI $7.5M AI safety fund
14. UK £1.6B AI investment
15. Oracle $50B infrastructure expansion
16. Model Context Protocol & training data exhaustion

**Templates ready**:
- 5 dollar-amount lead hooks
- 3 name-drop hooks
- 2 date + stat shock hooks
- 2 expert vulnerability hooks
- 3 educational simplification hooks
- 2 milestone/BIP angles
- 2 comparative advantage hooks

**Multi-topic diversification**: 10 content categories identified (enterprise, funding, rivalry, voice AI, robotics, regulation, government, safety, infrastructure, technology shifts)

## What Was Improved

**Consolidated file advantages**:
1. **Single source of truth** for Feb 2026 AI news
2. **16 angles vs 8+10** (removed duplication, preserved unique items)
3. **Better organization** (6 categories: Product Launches, Funding, Enterprise Adoption, Rivalry, Government, Infrastructure)
4. **Cross-platform templates** included (X + Bluesky adaptation rules)
5. **Evidence-based hooks** (dollar amounts, name drops, dates validated from both research sessions)

**Quality improvements**:
- Cross-referenced stats across multiple sources
- Removed redundant OpenAI Frontier coverage (both files had it)
- Merged enterprise adoption stats (Gartner/IDC data from both files)
- Unified hook templates (best formulas from both files)

---

## Process Improvement

**Prevention (add to workflow)**:
1. Before creating new research file, check for existing files on same topic/date:
   ```bash
   ls -lh agent/memory/research/ | grep -i "ai-news"
   ls -lh agent/memory/research/ | grep -i "feb.*20"
   ```
2. Use consistent naming: `topic-YYYY-MM-DD.md` format only (avoid month name variations)
3. If existing file found, append/edit rather than create duplicate

**Detection (periodic check)**:
- Memory directory review should flag files with similar names/topics
- File size comparison: Two 10KB+ files on same topic = likely duplicate

---

## Context Efficiency Gain

**Before**: Reading both files = 21.9KB context burned
**After**: Reading one file = 15.9KB context burned
**Savings**: **6KB per session** when referencing Feb 2026 AI news

**Impact**: Over 10 sessions referencing this research = 60KB saved context budget

---

## Graduation Status

**Deleted files** (graduated to consolidated version):
- ✅ `ai-news-2026-02-20.md` → Content merged into `ai-news-feb-2026-consolidated.md`
- ✅ `ai-news-feb-20-2026.md` → Content merged into `ai-news-feb-2026-consolidated.md`

**Key insights extracted**: None lost. All 16 angles, all hook templates, all sources preserved.

## Next Steps

**When queue <15 (Bluesky currently 16, 6th session blocked)**:
1. Use consolidated file to create 2 content pieces
2. Test dollar-amount leads (validated 3-6x impressions)
3. Diversify topics (max 50% agent content)
4. Apply cross-platform adaptation (X + Bluesky versions)

**Weekly retro (Sunday)**:
- Add consolidation pattern to memory cleanup protocol
- Document file naming standard
- Check for other duplicates across memory directory
