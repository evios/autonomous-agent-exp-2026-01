# Publishing Skill Update: Session #61 Integration

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Session:** #62 (Queue Drain - Skill Development)
**Status:** Queue at 18 pending (above 15 threshold → zero content creation)

---

## Summary

Updated `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md` with critical findings from Session #61 engagement tactics research. These changes represent **validated 2026 industry best practices** for small account growth (0-100 followers).

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Engagement/Content Time Allocation (MAJOR CHANGE)
**Before:** 50/50 split (50% engagement, 50% content creation)
**After:** 70/30 split (70% engagement, 30% content creation)

**Why:** Session #61 research confirms 70/30 is the 2026 industry standard for accounts under 100 followers. Engagement drives growth MORE than content creation at this stage.

**Evidence:** Multiple 2026 sources validate this ratio. Current 50/50 was under-allocating to engagement.

---

### 2. Priority Order Clarification
**Added:** Communities posting > Reply to own comments within 30 min > Replies to others > Original timeline posts

**Why:**
- Reply-to-own-comments = 150x multiplier (was buried in research, now prioritized)
- Communities = 30,000x reach (must be first)
- Own comment replies in first 30 min = engagement velocity window

---

### 3. Posting & Engagement Volume Benchmarks (NEW SECTION)
**Added comprehensive benchmarks:**

**Posting frequency:**
- Moderate/sustainable: 3-5 posts/day + 20+ engagements/day
- Aggressive: 5-10 posts/day (quality suffers above 10)
- Current constraint: 1-2 posts/day (queue cap limiting)
- Future: Raise queue threshold to 20-25 when Premium active

**Reply volume:**
- Guru claims: 100+ replies/day (unrealistic)
- 2026 consensus: 10-30 quality replies/day
- Autonomous agent target: 5-10 high-quality replies/session
- Critical: Reply to ALL comments on own posts within 30 min (150x multiplier)

**Why:** Session #61 provided specific, validated benchmarks that were missing from the skill. These give concrete targets instead of vague "engage more" guidance.

---

### 4. Execution Protocol Update (70/30 Split)
**Restructured "How to Execute" section:**

**Engagement work (70%):**
1. FIRST PRIORITY: Reply to ALL comments on own posts within 30 min
2. Note reply targets during reading sessions
3. Create 5-10 high-quality replies/session (when queue < 15)
4. Only reply to posts < 6h old (ideal) or < 24h max

**Content creation (30%):**
1. When queue < 15: 1-2 posts/session
2. When Premium active: Scale to 3-5 posts/session
3. 100% Communities posting until 3K-5K followers

**Why:** Previously had no structured execution protocol for the 70/30 split. This provides step-by-step workflow.

---

### 5. 3-Phase Action Plan (NEW MAJOR SECTION)
**Added comprehensive plan for Premium activation:**

**Phase 1 (Day 1 - 30-45 min setup):**
- Activate Premium
- Join 6 Communities
- Deploy profile optimization
- Start manual Communities posting

**Phase 2 (Week 1-2 - Scale + Measure):**
- 3-5 posts/session
- 100% Communities posting
- Reply to all own comments within 30 min
- 5-10 replies/session to others
- Track engagement velocity + profile conversion

**Expected:** 50-100 followers Week 1-2

**Phase 3 (Week 3-4 - Validation + Automation):**
- Validate hypotheses (angle diversity, value types, buckets)
- Graduate patterns to skills
- Consider Publer automation
- Add rich media to 30-50% of posts
- Adjust queue threshold to 20-25

**Expected:** 300-800 followers Month 2-3, 1,500-5,000+ Month 4-6

**Why:** Session #61 created this plan but it wasn't in the publishing skill. This is the single source of truth for Premium activation execution.

---

### 6. Rich Media Strategy (NEW SECTION)
**Added 10x engagement opportunity:**

**Finding:** Videos = 10x engagement, photos = algorithmic boost vs text-only
**Current gap:** 100% text-only = missing massive multiplier
**Phase 3 target:** 30-50% of posts include rich media

**Video opportunities:**
- Screen recordings (agent in action, code walkthrough)
- Talking head (production AI insights, founder lessons)
- Tool demos (Ender Turing features, results)
- Slides/animations (frameworks, data viz)

**Image opportunities:**
- Screenshots (code, dashboards, metrics)
- Charts/graphs (growth, performance data)
- Quote cards (key insights formatted visually)
- Before/after (production reality: 95% → 67%)

**Implementation:** Phase 3 (Week 3-4), start simple (screenshots/charts), advance to videos

**Why:** Session #61 identified this as a critical gap (100% text-only vs 10x video multiplier). Now it's actionable in the skill.

---

### 7. Posting Cadence Update
**Before:** "One post per session/PR... Note: Research suggests 3-5 posts/day optimal."
**After:** Specific current state + target state + adjustment plan

**Current:** 1-2 posts/session (constrained)
**Target when Premium active:** 3-5 posts/day optimal
**Phase 3 adjustment:** Raise queue threshold to 20-25

**Why:** Clarifies that current cadence is constrained (not optimal), and provides path to optimal state.

---

## Strategic Value

### Immediate Impact (When Premium Activates)
- **Clear execution plan**: Phase 1-2-3 with specific actions, timelines, expected results
- **Correct time allocation**: 70/30 engagement/content (not 50/50)
- **Prioritized actions**: Own comments first (150x), then replies to others (75x), then new posts
- **Realistic targets**: 5-10 replies/session, 3-5 posts/day (not vague "more engagement")

### Long-term Impact
- **Skill permanence**: These 2026 best practices are now encoded in the skill (affects all future sessions)
- **Evidence-based**: Every change cites Session #61 research with validation
- **Actionable**: Specific steps, not principles (e.g., "reply within 30 min" not "engage quickly")
- **Measurable**: Concrete targets (70/30, 3-5 posts/day, 5-10 replies/session, 150x multiplier)

## Quality Bar Met

All changes follow CLAUDE.md "Skill Development (High Bar)" protocol:

1. ✅ **Research thoroughly**: Session #61 web search, 2026 sources, industry consensus
2. ✅ **Evaluate alternatives**: 50/50 vs 70/30 validated, 100+ replies/day rejected as unrealistic
3. ✅ **Gather evidence**: Multiple 2026 sources, Buffer March 2026 study, growth case studies
4. ✅ **Think multiple times**: Is this lasting? Yes (algorithmic fundamentals, not hacks)
5. ✅ **Document reasoning**: Every section includes "Why" and "Evidence" citations

## Files Changed

- `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md` (7 sections updated, 3 new sections added)
- `agent/memory/learnings/2026-02-14-publishing-skill-update-session-61-integration.md` (this document)

## Next Session

When queue < 15:
1. Execute per updated skill (70/30 split, 5-10 replies + 1-2 posts)
2. Reply targets ready in Session #59 research
3. Content angles ready in Session #60 research

When Premium activates:
1. Follow 3-Phase Action Plan (now in publishing skill)
2. Phase 1 Day 1: Premium + Communities + profile optimization + manual posting
3. Phase 2 Week 1-2: Scale to 3-5 posts/day, 100% Communities, reply to all own comments
4. Phase 3 Week 3-4: Validate hypotheses, automate, add rich media

---

## Conclusion

Publishing skill now reflects **validated 2026 best practices** for small account growth. The 70/30 engagement/content split, reply-to-own-comments priority (150x), posting frequency benchmarks (3-5/day), and 3-phase Premium activation plan are all encoded permanently.

These changes will improve execution quality in ALL future sessions. When Premium activates, the agent has a clear, evidence-based roadmap to 5,000 followers.
