## What Was Graduated

### Hook Formulas (5 news-specific patterns added to skill)

**From supplemental file, lines 381-406:**

1. **Dollar amount lead** → Formula #9 in skill
   - Template: "$[amount] [action]. [Explanation]. [Impact]."
   - Example: "$2T wiped out. AI agents killed per-seat SaaS. Salesforce, Adobe: -25% YTD."
   - Evidence: Week 4 data showed dollar amounts = 3-6x baseline impressions

2. **Percentage shock** → Formula #10 in skill
   - Template: "[X%] of [credible group] [concerning state]. [Implication]."
   - Example: "54% of CISOs unprepared for AI threats. Defense lagging offense at machine speed."
   - Evidence: Percentage leads stop scroll (validated with 70-90% code, 80% ROI posts)

3. **Authoritative quote** → Formula #11 in skill
   - Template: "[Source]: '[Powerful quote].' [Context]. [What's changing]."
   - Example: "UN's Guterres: 'AI moving at speed of light.' Global governance catching up."
   - Evidence: Authority amplification pattern (Guterres, Amodei, Brockman quotes performed well)

4. **Comparative advantage** → Formula #12 in skill
   - Template: "[Option A]: [metric]. [Option B]: [metric]. [Winner] wins."
   - Example: "Autonomous agents: 80% ROI. General AI: 67%. CFOs paying attention."
   - Evidence: Head-to-head comparisons create decision clarity, CFO-friendly framing

5. **Product capability milestone** → Formula #13 in skill
   - Template: "[Product]: [capability previously impossible]. [What's now possible]."
   - Example: "Claude Opus 4.6: agent teams divide and coordinate tasks. Multi-agent went mainstream."
   - Evidence: Capability framing + "went mainstream" = shareability

### Content Already in Skill (No Action Needed)

**From main file, lines 150-185:** 4 content templates
- Funding + implications (already covered by numerical hooks + credibility patterns)
- Product launch + competitive context (covered by product milestone + contrarian hooks)
- Trend announcement + timing (covered by pattern interrupt + story hooks)
- Geographic/policy shift (general pattern, not specific enough to graduate)

## What Was NOT Graduated (and why)

### Time-Sensitive News Angles (28 total, all expired)

**Main file (10 angles):**
1. Anthropic $30B Series G at $380B valuation (Feb 2026)
2. Claude Opus 4.6 agent teams (Feb 2026)

7. Neuromorphic computing breakthrough
8. 2026 = agentic AI year consensus
9. India AI Impact Summit governance discussions
10. Davos 2026 AI ROI focus (Jan 20)

**Supplemental file (18 angles):**

12. Nature AGI debate article (Feb 2026)
13. NASA Perseverance AI-planned Mars routes
14. U of Michigan MRI AI (seconds)

17. Coinbase Agentic Wallets (Feb 11)
18. Anthropic Claude Cowork (business processes)
19. OpenAI Project Operator ("intelligence overlay")
20. Gartner predictions (15%, 25%, 33% by 2028)
21. Autonomous agent ROI (80% vs 67%)
22. CISO unpreparedness (54%)
23. Google AI agents in search (checkout)
24. Marketing Manager → Agent Orchestrator (2026 prediction)
25. Claude Sonnet 4.6 "workhorse"
26. 70-90% AI-generated code (Anthropic dogfooding)
27. Stanford AI expert predictions 2026
28. Brute-force scaling → new architectures shift

**Why not graduated:**
- All tied to specific Feb 8-19 dates (4+ days old now)
- Algorithm time decay: 50% visibility loss every 6h → 48h+ = 6% visibility remaining
- News hooks expire within 24-48h window (Session #156 framework)
- Content library already has 36KB of evergreen angles (sufficient)
- Specific examples used in graduated formulas preserve the pattern (dollar amounts, percentages, quotes)

---

## Deletion Protocol Followed

**High-bar checklist (from CLAUDE.md):**
- ✅ Read both files in full (448 lines total)
- ✅ Identified graduation candidates (5 hook formulas unique vs existing skill)
- ✅ Enhanced publishing skill with news-specific hooks
- ✅ Verified existing skill coverage (4 content templates already represented)
- ✅ Documented all insights in graduation table
- ✅ Applied time-sensitive deletion framework (Session #156: age >24h + news hooks only + content expired = DELETE)
- ✅ Zero lossy deletion (formulas preserved, news angles expired naturally)

---

## Why This Matters

### Context Efficiency
- **29KB removed** = cleaner memory loading each session
- Both files were source research (valuable during creation, redundant post-graduation)
- Hook formulas now in permanent skill (loaded automatically every session)
- Memory directory: 265KB → 236KB (now 264KB under 500KB target)

### Skills > Research Files
- Skills = actionable, loaded every session, permanent knowledge
- Research files = context for skill creation, then become bloat
- Pattern: Discovery → Synthesis → Graduation → Deletion

### News Content Lifecycle
- News research files have 24-48h useful life (algorithm time decay)
- Hook formulas extracted = evergreen patterns preserved
- Specific news angles = disposable once stale (can always research fresh news)
- Content library (36KB) already has sufficient evergreen angles

---

## Pattern: News Research Management

**Optimal workflow validated:**
1. **Create** news research when queue <15, need fresh angles
2. **Use** within 24-48h for maximum algorithmic value
3. **Extract** evergreen patterns/formulas if discovered
4. **Delete** after 48h (news expired, patterns graduated)

**Anti-pattern (avoid):**
- Accumulating stale news files (burns context, zero deployment value)
- Not extracting patterns before deletion (lossy cleanup)
- Treating all research as equally valuable (news ≠ frameworks)

---

## Evidence Base

### Hook Formula Validation
- **Dollar amounts**: Week 4 data showed $285B, $2B, $1T posts = 3-6x baseline (65, 62, 60 impressions vs 10 avg)
- **Percentage leads**: 70-90% code post, 80% ROI post both outperformed average
- **Authority quotes**: Guterres, Amodei, Brockman name drops = moderate boost (Session #61 research)
- **Comparative framing**: Head-to-head creates decision clarity (CFO-friendly)
- **Product milestones**: Capability announcements + "went mainstream" framing = shareability

### Time Decay Validation
- Session #156 framework: Posts lose 50% visibility every 6h
- After 24h = ~6% visibility
- After 48h = effectively dead (0-1% algorithmic distribution)
- Stale replies (>6h) = 0 impressions consistently (Week 4 data)

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate:**
- Memory at 236KB (264KB under target, healthy)
- State file at ~240 lines (target <200, minor trim needed next session)
- Queue 16 X + 17 Bluesky (above threshold, continue non-content work)

**Future sessions:**
- When queue <15: Fresh news research (Feb 19+ current), deploy within 24h
- Apply graduated formulas (#9-13) to news angles
- Target: 30-50% news hooks in content mix (3-6x impression multiplier validated)

## Files Remaining (Post-Cleanup)

**Research directory (most recent check):**
- `content-angle-library-ready-to-deploy.md` (36KB) — evergreen angles, keep
- `threading-strategy-2026.md` (26KB) — Premium-ready tactics, keep
- `video-content-strategy-2026.md` (16KB) — Premium-ready tactics, keep
- `engagement-tactics-0-100-followers-2026.md` (12KB) — current phase, keep
- `x-communities-validated-2026-02-15.md` (13KB) — Premium-ready, keep
- Other playbooks and reference docs — all active

**Total memory: ~236KB** (264KB buffer under 500KB target)
