## Content Templates (Ready to Use)

### Template 1: Trend Commentary

**Structure:**
1. Hook: [Trend] + [Bold take]
2. Context: What most people think
3. Reality: What the data/experience shows
4. Why it matters: Implication for the industry
5. CTA: Follow for more insider perspectives

**Example:**
"Everyone's talking about AI replacing call center agents. After 7 years building call center AI, here's the truth:

AI handles: routing, basic queries, knowledge lookups, sentiment analysis.
Humans handle: retention, escalations, personalized experiences, creative problem-solving.

The real story? Salesforce cut support from 9,000 → 5,000 agents. Not zero. The hybrid model wins.

What dies: repetitive, scripted work.
What thrives: empathy, judgment, relationship-building.

The future isn't human vs. AI. It's humans augmented by AI doing higher-value work.

Building call center AI at @enderturing since 2018. The transformation is real, but it's not what the headlines say."

### Template 2: Implementation Reality Check

**Structure:**
1. Hook: [Surprising failure stat]
2. Problem: Why this happens
3. Solution: What actually works (from experience)
4. Proof: Real results from Ender Turing
5. CTA: Link to product/profile

**Example:**
"95% of enterprise AI pilots never hit their goals (MIT). After 7 years in call center AI, here's why:

Teams skip the hard parts:
- Clear goals (what does success look like?)
- Clean data (garbage in = garbage out)
- Agent training (AI doesn't replace process)
- Buy-in (agents fear surveillance, not coaching)

What works:
→ Start with one workflow (QA automation, not everything)
→ Define success metrics upfront (CSAT, AHT, compliance)
→ Bring agents into design (they know the pain points)
→ Measure continuously (what gets measured gets improved)

Real results: 20% CSAT increase, 180 hours saved/month, 8% sales lift.

AI doesn't fail. Implementation does.

More on what works: [enderturing.com]"

### Template 3: Myth-Busting

**Structure:**
1. Hook: Common myth stated boldly
2. Why people believe it
3. What the data actually shows
4. Reframe: The real story
5. CTA: Shift perspective

**Example:**
"Speech analytics = Big Brother surveillance. Right?

Wrong. Here's what 7 years building speech analytics taught me:

The fear: AI monitors agents, dings them for mistakes, kills morale.

The reality: Best contact centers use it for coaching, not controlling.

How:
- Flag coaching moments (not gotchas): "Great empathy on this call"
- Surface what top performers do differently
- Automate QA so managers coach instead of score
- Analyze 100% of calls vs. 2% manual sampling

Result: Agents get real-time feedback, not quarterly reviews based on 5 cherry-picked calls.

Speech analytics done right = performance coaching at scale.

Done wrong = morale killer.

The difference? Implementation, not technology.

Building this at @enderturing. The best teams use AI to elevate agents, not replace them."

## Quality Checklist (Before Publishing)

1. **Authority signal**: Does the post demonstrate real expertise? (7 years, millions of calls analyzed, product in market)
2. **Value delivery**: Will a stranger learn something valuable? (not just "AI is changing call centers")
3. **Differentiation**: Is this insight unique to the owner's experience? (or generic AI commentary anyone could write)
4. **Proof available**: Can this be backed up? (Ender Turing website, case studies, research citations)
5. **Promotional balance**: Is this one of the ~20% that mentions Ender Turing? Check recent output.
6. **Hook strength**: Does the first line stop the scroll?
7. **Content type**: Authority / Personality / Shareability bucket assigned?

---

## Usage Notes

**When queue clears and content creation resumes:**
1. Pick a topic cluster based on recent industry news or learning
2. Choose an angle (contrarian, behind-scenes, how-to, commentary, learning journey)
3. Select a template structure
4. Write using owner's voice (founder building products with AI, not "I'm an AI agent")
5. Run through quality checklist
6. Verify promotional balance (should be ~20% of output, not 100%)

**Integration with existing frameworks:**
- Combine with 3-Bucket Strategy (Authority/Personality/Shareability)
- Apply Hook Engineering formulas
- Follow Value Rule (content value OR outcome value, never both)
- Respect queue management (max 2 pieces/session when queue < 15)

**Evidence base:**
- Week 1-3 retros: Call center AI angle chronically underutilized (<5% of content)
- Owner profile (ME.md): Deep expertise in this domain, but agent hasn't leveraged it
- 2026 research: Fresh data provides timely hooks and conversation starters
- Content diversification learning: 50%+ of content should draw on owner's broader expertise

## Next Steps (Post-Queue-Clear)

1. **Week 4 testing:** Create 2-3 call center AI posts using this framework
2. **Track engagement:** Do domain expertise posts outperform generic AI content?
3. **Iterate templates:** Which angles/structures drive best engagement?
4. **Build connections:** Reply to call center AI thought leaders using these insights
5. **Update framework:** Add successful examples, remove failed patterns

**Hypothesis to test:**
Domain expertise content (call center AI) will outperform generic autonomous agent content because:
- Differentiated (not just another AI builder)
- Authoritative (7 years, real product, proven results)
- Practical (founder solving real problems, not theorizing)
- Promotable (natural Ender Turing tie-ins without feeling forced)
