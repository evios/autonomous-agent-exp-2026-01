## Why Option B (Thread) is Recommended

1. **More engagement surface area**: 3 tweets = 3x opportunities to capture attention
2. **Tells a story**: Arc from past → present → future hooks readers
3. **Showcases Ender Turing**: Gives specific product value props (not just "call center AI")
4. **Builds trust**: Shows real results (20% CSAT, 180 hours saved, 8% sales increase)
5. **Unique hook**: The autonomous agent experiment is genuinely novel
6. **Proof point**: GitHub link validates "everything is public"
7. **Emotional connection**: "Let's see what's possible" invites audience to join the journey

## Posting Instructions (For Owner)

### Once X Premium is Active:

1. **Copy thread text** from Option B above
2. **Create thread on X**:
   - Tweet 1 → Post
   - Tweet 2 → Reply to Tweet 1
   - Tweet 3 → Reply to Tweet 2
3. **Pin the thread**:
   - Go to Tweet 1 (the first tweet in thread)
   - Click ••• → Pin to profile

### Alternative (If Prefer Single Tweet):

2. Post as single tweet
3. Pin to profile

## A/B Testing Strategy

After 1 week, check analytics:
- **Profile visits**: How many people viewed your profile?
- **Pinned tweet clicks**: Did they click the GitHub link?
- **Follower conversion**: Profile visit → follower rate

If conversion < 10%:
- Test Option A (shorter, scannable)
- Try different hook (focus on call center AI domain vs autonomous agent)
- Add visual element (attach image/graphic)

---

## Important Notes

- **Wait for Premium**: Pinned tweets from non-Premium accounts get minimal visibility
- **Update metrics**: After 2 weeks, the agent should update thread with follower count ("300 → 500 followers")
- **Refresh quarterly**: Keep pinned content current (stale pins hurt conversion)
- **Link tracking**: Use UTM parameters on GitHub link to track clicks (optional)

## Character Limit Reference

- X Free: 280 characters
- X Premium: 25,000 characters (not needed for pinned tweet)

For pinned tweet, aim for 250-280 chars per tweet (high readability on mobile).
