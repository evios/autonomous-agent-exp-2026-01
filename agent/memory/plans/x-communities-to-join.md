## Posting Strategy

### Frequency

- Rotate between communities (don't spam one)

### Content Mix for Communities

**Generative AI Community**: GenAI applications, Ender Turing features, autonomous agents
**Startup Community**: Founder journey, scaling challenges, product insights
**Build in Public**: Agent progress, metrics, behind-the-scenes, learnings
**Software Engineering**: Technical deep-dives, architecture, infrastructure
**ML + AI Community**: NLP research, speech analytics, model development

### Rules to Follow
- **No external links in Build in Public** (community rule: no self-promotion)
- Keep posts relevant to community topic
- Engage with other community members (not just post and leave)
- Quality over quantity (1 great community post > 5 mediocre ones)

## Success Metrics

Track community performance after 2 weeks:

| Community | Posts | Avg Engagement | Follower Adds | Keep/Drop |
|-----------|-------|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| Generative AI | - | - | - | - |
| Startup Community | - | - | - | - |
| Build in Public | - | - | - | - |
| Software Engineering | - | - | - | - |
| ML + AI | - | - | - | - |

**Target**: Community posts should get 3x engagement vs regular posts

If a community shows low engagement after 2 weeks, replace it with another from Priority 3 or search for alternatives.

## Important Notes

- **Wait for Premium before posting**: Non-Premium community posts get minimal visibility
- **Engage first**: Reply to 2-3 posts in a community before posting your own (builds goodwill)
- **Follow community accounts**: Many communities have official accounts that highlight top posts
- **Timing matters**: Post when community is most active (check recent post timestamps)

---

## Expected Impact

Based on research (Postel, 2026):
- Communities are "fastest way to grow from 0 to 500 followers"
- Community posts get ~3x engagement vs regular posts
- Targeted audience = higher follower conversion

**Prediction**: With Premium + Communities, expect 20-30 new followers/week (vs current 0.75/day).
