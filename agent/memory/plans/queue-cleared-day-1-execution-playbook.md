# Queue Cleared: Day 1 Execution Playbook

**Created**: 2026-02-11 (Session #41)
**Purpose**: When queue < 15, this is your step-by-step playbook for immediate execution.
**Context**: 7 sessions of research (S26-40) created comprehensive deployment assets. This synthesizes everything into actionable Day 1 priorities.

---

## Pre-Flight Checklist

Before creating ANY content, verify:

- [ ] Queue < 15? (If no, continue draining - ZERO content creation)
- [ ] X Premium active? (If no, content will get 0% engagement - wait or create awareness for owner)
- [ ] Communities joined? (If Premium but no Communities, remind owner - 5 min setup for 30,000x reach)
- [ ] Profile optimized? (If not, that's Priority 0 - see below)

---

## Priority 0: Profile Optimization (IF NOT DONE)

**DO THIS FIRST** - Profile converts traffic to followers. Without it, you leak 50-70% of potential growth.

**Time required**: 90-120 minutes total (can split across sessions)

### Step 1: Update Bio (15-30 min)
**Selected bio** (from Session #35):
```
Building Voice AI for call centers. 7 years, 500K+ interactions. Production reality > vendor hype.
```
- 107 characters (optimal: 91)
- Formula: [What you do] + [Credibility] + [Differentiation]
- Alternatives available in: `agent/memory/plans/profile-optimization-deployment-ready.md`

**Owner action required**: Update X bio manually (agent cannot do this via API)

### Step 2: Create Pinned Tweet (30-45 min)
**Selected format**: Thread-Style Resume (5 tweets)

Template in: `agent/memory/plans/profile-optimization-deployment-ready.md` (lines 45-65)

**Create as**: `agent/outputs/x/thread-YYYYMMDD-001.txt`

**Key elements**:
- Tweet 1: Hook (triple credibility: Voice AI + production systems + autonomous agent)
- Tweets 2-4: Three value propositions (call center AI expertise, production reality, BIP experiment)
- Tweet 5: CTA (Follow for production AI insights)
- 0 links in main content (pure content value)
- Vulnerability + authority balance (95% → 67% gap)

**After posting**: Pin manually via X web UI (agent cannot pin via API)

### Step 3: Banner Design Brief (60 min - owner creates)
**Content**: "500K+ calls analyzed | 20% CSAT increase | 7 years Voice AI"
**Tools**: Canva, Venngage, BrandBird, Figma
**Size**: 1500x500px
**Impact**: Expected 30% conversion boost

Full brief in: `agent/memory/plans/profile-optimization-deployment-ready.md` (lines 90-110)

**Note**: Agent creates the brief/spec, owner executes design work.

---

## Priority 1: Timely Content (Execute FIRST - News Hooks Decay Fast)

**Why first**: Feb 2026 news (Opus 4.6, GPT-5.3, production gap) loses relevance every day. Execute within 24-48 hours of queue clearing.

**Source**: `agent/memory/research/reading-notes/2026-02-11-ai-discourse-feb-11-current.md`

### Day 1 Content Plan (2 pieces max per session)

**Piece 1: Opus 4.6 + GPT-5.3 Convergence** (TIMELY - Feb 6 releases)
- **Hook**: "Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3 Codex dropped within 20 minutes of each other. Here's what convergence means that most people miss:"
- **Angle**: Shareability (contrarian pattern interrupt)
- **Value type**: Content value (0 links)
- **Length**: 3-4 tweet thread
- **Voice**: Conversational, simplified, one idea per tweet
- **Content**: Competition → pragmatism (2026 = year AI gets practical). Implications for builders (focus on making AI usable, not bigger models).
- **Source data**: Session #39, lines 80-85
- **File**: `agent/outputs/x/thread-YYYYMMDD-001.txt`

**Piece 2: The 11% Production Gap** (TIMELY + AUTHORITY)
- **Hook**: "Only 11% of agentic AI is in production. Gartner predicts 40% by end of 2026. Here's the gap nobody's talking about:"
- **Angle**: Authority (production expertise + call center AI)
- **Value type**: Content value (0 links)
- **Length**: Single tweet or 3-tweet thread
- **Voice**: Direct, candid, production-focused
- **Content**: Integration complexity (our 7 years experience), hybrid model reality (25-45% productivity gains), vendor hype vs production truth (95% → 67% accuracy).
- **Source data**: Session #39 lines 83, Session #38 (call center AI reality)
- **File**: `agent/outputs/x/tweet-YYYYMMDD-002.txt`

**Why these two**:
- Both are timely (Feb 2026 news, won't be relevant in 2 weeks)
- Demonstrate angle diversity (shareability + authority)
- 0 links (pure content value, testing hypothesis from Session #34)
- Apply hook engineering (pattern interrupt, contrarian, numerical claim)
- Draw on our expertise (7 years call center AI, production systems)

---

## Priority 2: Test Corrected Content Strategy (Days 2-5)

**Goal**: Validate hypotheses from Session #34 content analysis.

**Hypotheses to test** (from `agent/memory/hypotheses/`):
1. **Angle diversity = 2-3x engagement**: Call center AI posts outperform autonomous agent posts
2. **Pure content value = 3-5x engagement**: Posts with 0 links outperform posts with links
3. **Personality content = 2-3x engagement**: Vulnerability + authority > authority alone
4. **Shareability content = 3-5x shares**: Contrarian takes, analogies, relatable struggles

### Content Mix Targets (Next 10 Posts)

**Angle allocation** (50/50 rule):
- 5 posts: Call center AI, startup lessons, infrastructure → AI, broader AI commentary
- 5 posts: Autonomous agent BIP, Specification Engineering, PDCA cycles

**Content bucket allocation** (40/30/30 rule):
- 4 posts: Authority (frameworks, how-tos, production insights)
- 3 posts: Personality (vulnerability, behind-scenes, career stories)
- 3 posts: Shareability (contrarian takes, analogies, relatable struggles)

**Link allocation** (20% rule):
- 8 posts: Pure content value (0 links)
- 2 posts: Outcome value (repo link or Ender Turing link)

**NEVER mix content + outcome value in same post** (Value Rule from Session #34)

### Execution Plan (10 Posts, 5 Sessions @ 2 Posts/Session)

**Session 1 (Day 1 - TIMELY)**:
- Thread: Opus/GPT convergence (shareability, 0 links)
- Tweet: 11% production gap (authority, 0 links)

**Session 2 (Day 2 - PERSONALITY)**:
- Tweet: "95% → 67% accuracy gap still keeps me up at night" (personality, 0 links, Karpathy pattern)
- Tweet: Infrastructure 2006 vs AI 2026 timeline comparison (shareability, 0 links)

**Session 3 (Day 3 - AUTHORITY + BIP)**:
- Tweet: "AI accuracy is the wrong metric. Here's what actually predicts call center success..." (authority, 0 links, contrarian)
- Tweet: Autonomous agent BIP update (outcome value, repo link allowed)

**Session 4 (Day 4 - SHAREABILITY)**:
- Tweet: "Client asks 'Why not ChatGPT?' Me (internal): *screaming*" (shareability, 0 links, relatable)
- Tweet: Startup hiring struggles - "Hired experts, lost them in 6 months. Chaos tolerance > skills" (personality, 0 links)

**Session 5 (Day 5 - AUTHORITY + PROMOTION)**:
- Tweet: Hybrid model consensus (25-45% productivity, authority, 0 links)
- Tweet: Ender Turing case study (outcome value, link allowed, 20% CSAT proof)

**Sources for templates**:
- Authority templates: `agent/memory/plans/content-templates-corrected-strategy.md` (Session #35)
- Personality templates: `agent/memory/learnings/2026-02-11-personality-shareability-content-patterns.md` (Session #36)
- Shareability templates: Same as personality (Session #36)
- Call center AI angles: `agent/memory/research/reading-notes/2026-02-11-call-center-ai-production-reality-2026.md` (Session #38)
- Feb 2026 discourse angles: `agent/memory/research/reading-notes/2026-02-11-ai-discourse-feb-11-current.md` (Session #39)

## Priority 3: Launch Communities Strategy (IF Premium Active)

**CRITICAL**: Communities = 30,000x reach multiplier (180K members vs 6 followers)

**Prerequisite**: X Premium active + 6 Communities joined

### Communities to Join (5 min total - owner action)
1. **Build in Public** (180K members) - BIP content
2. **AI/ML Builders** (50-100K) - Autonomous agents, agentic AI
3. **Startup Founders** (100K+) - Startup journey content
4. **Call Center AI** (10-20K) - Voice AI, speech analytics
5. **Infrastructure→AI** (5-10K) - Career transition stories
6. **Indie Hackers** (150K) - Solo founder content

### Manual Phase 1 Posting (START HERE)
**Protocol** (from Session #12 research):
1. Repo owner reviews queue daily
2. Select top 1-2 pieces (best hooks, highest value)
3. Post via X web UI to 2-3 relevant Communities
4. Check "Also share with followers" box (dual distribution)
5. Track follower growth daily

**Why manual first**: Validate hypothesis before building automation. Expected: 10x follower growth (0.75/day → 7.5/day).

**Time commitment**: 5 min/day (owner responsibility until Publer automation)

**Success criteria**: 50-100 followers in 2 weeks (vs. 0.75/day baseline = 10-20 followers)

**Source**: `agent/memory/research/2026-02-10-x-communities-integration-2026.md`

---

## Priority 4: Apply Voice Protocol (EVERY Post)

**Source**: `agent/memory/research/reading-notes/2026-02-11-authentic-voice-ai-assisted-content.md` (Session #40)

**Problem**: Session #34 diagnosed content sounded robotic/formulaic.
**Solution**: Voice protocol ensures authentic human voice in AI-assisted content.

### Voice Checklist (Run on EVERY Piece Before Publishing)

#### 1. Sentence Variety (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Mix short (5-8 words), medium (12-15 words), long (20+ words) sentences
- [ ] NOT all sentences same length (AI default)
- [ ] Read aloud - does rhythm feel natural or mechanical?

#### 2. Emotion & Personality
- [ ] Includes emotion/opinion ("I can't help but feel...", "This infuriates me...", "Honestly...")
- [ ] NOT neutral corporate voice
- [ ] Passes "sounds like a human, not a bot" test

#### 3. Colloquialisms & Informal Language
- [ ] Uses conversational language ("Here's the thing", "Honestly", "The truth is")
- [ ] Includes idioms or informal phrases where natural
- [ ] NOT overly formal or academic

#### 4. Personal Anecdotes & Experiences
- [ ] Includes specific story/example from our experience (7 years call center AI, 15 years startups, infrastructure → AI)
- [ ] NOT generic observations that apply to anyone
- [ ] Specificity = authenticity (500K interactions, 95% → 67%, 20% CSAT, 160 PRs)

#### 5. Avoid AI Tells
- [ ] NO "utilize"/"leverage"/"facilitate" (use "use"/"use"/"help")
- [ ] NO em dash overuse (—)
- [ ] NO all bullets (mix paragraphs)
- [ ] NO "In today's...", "It's important to note..." (generic AI starters)

#### 6. Conversational & Simple
- [ ] Talk to friend, not corporate audience
- [ ] One idea per tweet (not packed dense)
- [ ] Line breaks for readability (not wall of text)

#### 7. Read Aloud Test (FINAL CHECK)
- [ ] Read entire piece out loud
- [ ] Does it sound like YOU speaking? (Direct, candid, production-focused)
- [ ] If it sounds like corporate AI → rewrite

### Our Voice Dimensions (Reference)
**From Session #40 research:**
- **Tone**: Direct, candid, production-focused
- **Personality**: Engineer with production scars, shares truth vendors hide
- **Expertise**: 7 years call center AI, 15 years startup, autonomous agent
- **POV**: Production reality > vendor hype, hybrid > replacement, integration = real project

**Voice markers** (use frequently):
- Vulnerability at authority's peak ("7 years in, the 95% → 67% gap still keeps me up at night")
- Specific numbers (500K, 95%→67%, 20% CSAT, 160 PRs, 14 systems)
- Behind-scenes truth ("Sold on 20% (AI). Hired for 80% (integration hell)")
- Career honesty (Infrastructure engineer → AI founder, what didn't transfer)

## Priority 5: Engagement Strategy (70/30 Allocation)

**Source**: `.claude/skills/commenting/SKILL.md`

**Rule**: For accounts < 100 followers, **70% time on engagement, 30% on creation**.

### Why Engagement First
- Reply-to-reply = 75x algorithm multiplier
- One viral reply = 12K impressions vs 400 from original post (30x)
- Mid-tier account replies (10K-100K followers) = 10-20x reach vs timeline posts
- Exposure to established audiences (their 50K vs our 6)

### Daily Reply Protocol (20-30 Replies/Day Target)

**Morning (15-20 min):**
1. Find 10-15 posts from mid-tier accounts (10K-100K followers)
2. Posts must be 2-6 hours old (fresh, gaining momentum)
3. Topics: call center AI, agentic systems, startups, infrastructure → AI
4. Reply using frameworks (see below)

**Evening (15-20 min):**
1. Reply to ALL comments on your own posts (first hour critical)
2. Find 10-15 more target posts
3. Reply using frameworks

**Agent Session Allocation (When Queue < 15)**:
- Max 2 content pieces per session (1 original post + 1 reply)
- OR 2 replies (no original post)
- Spread replies across sessions for natural cadence
- **Max 5 pending replies at any time** (timeliness > volume)

### Reply Frameworks (Use Variety - NOT Formulaic)

#### Framework 1: Respectful Disagreement (Sparks Reply-to-Reply)
```
I see your point on [X], but I'd argue [Y] because [specific reason].

In my experience [specific example], which suggests [alternative take].

What am I missing here?
```

#### Framework 2: Add Value with Specific Insight
```
[Agree with hook].

Here's one thing most people miss: [specific, non-obvious insight].

[Optional: 1-2 sentence example]
```

#### Framework 3: Add Tactical Framework
```
[Validate the post].

Quick framework I use:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]
```

#### Framework 4: Ask a Sharp Question
```
[Acknowledge the post].

Question: [specific, non-obvious question tied to their expertise]

[Optional: Brief context]
```

#### Framework 5: Share Contrarian Data Point
```
[Agree or disagree with specific point].

Interesting counter-data: [specific stat or example].

[Your interpretation]
```

### Reply Quality Checklist

**✅ Must Have:**
- [ ] Adds insight the OP didn't mention
- [ ] Shows domain expertise (specific examples, frameworks, data)
- [ ] 2-4 sentences (concise and valuable)
- [ ] Would make someone click your profile
- [ ] Post is < 24 hours old (ideally 2-6 hours)
- [ ] Target account is mid-tier (10K-100K followers)

**❌ Never Do:**
- [ ] Generic praise ("Great post!", "This!", "🔥")
- [ ] Self-promotion ("Check out my thread")
- [ ] Adding links (reduces algorithmic distribution)
- [ ] Replying to posts >24h old
- [ ] Replying to mega-accounts (>500K) where reply gets buried
- [ ] Formulaic pattern (same structure every time)

### Reply Angle Diversity (CRITICAL - Week 3 Learning)
**DON'T**: Connect every reply to autonomous agent experiment (reads as automated self-promotion)

**DO**: Vary angles based on their post topic:
- Call center AI posts → Share 7 years production experience
- Startup posts → Share founder lessons (15 years)
- Infrastructure posts → Share network eng → AI transition
- Agentic AI posts → Share autonomous agent experiment (when truly relevant)
- Broader AI posts → Share production vs hype perspective

**Evidence**: Week 3 replies all followed same pattern (reference their point → connect to agent → add repo link). Result: 31 replies posted, +1 follower gained.

---

## Priority 6: Track Metrics & Validate Hypotheses

**Blocker**: Requires X Premium (analytics access)

**Once Premium active**, track these metrics daily:

### Growth Metrics
- Followers (daily)
- Impressions per post
- Engagement rate (likes + replies + retweets / impressions)
- Profile visits
- Follower source (timeline vs communities vs replies)

### Content Performance (Validate Hypotheses)
Track each post against:
1. **Angle** (call center AI vs agent vs startup vs infrastructure vs broader AI)
2. **Bucket** (authority vs personality vs shareability)
3. **Links** (0 links vs 1 link)
4. **Hook formula used** (which of 8 formulas)
5. **Engagement results** (impressions, likes, replies, retweets, profile visits)

### Success Metrics (Weekly Review)
- Which angle gets highest engagement? (Test: call center AI > agent)
- Do 0-link posts outperform linked posts? (Test: 3-5x expected)
- Does personality content outperform authority-only? (Test: 2-3x expected)
- Which hook formulas work best? (Track top 3)
- Are Communities driving follower growth? (Test: 10x expected)

### Hypothesis Validation (After 20 Posts)
From `agent/memory/hypotheses/`:
- [ ] Angle diversity hypothesis (call center AI = 2-3x engagement vs agent)
- [ ] Pure content value hypothesis (0 links = 3-5x engagement vs links)
- [ ] Personality content hypothesis (vulnerability + authority = 2-3x vs authority alone)
- [ ] Shareability content hypothesis (contrarian/analogies = 3-5x shares)

**Action**: After 20 posts, graduate validated patterns to skills. Remove/revise patterns that didn't work.

---

## Content Creation Checklist (Before Every Post)

**From Session #36, updated with voice protocol:**

1. **Queue check**: Total pending < 15? (If no, STOP)
2. **Quality gate**: Would a stranger follow you based on this post alone?
3. **Value type**: Content value OR outcome value? (Never both)
4. **Length**: As long as needed, concise and valuable (not padded)
5. **Link allocation**: Only ~20% of posts should have links
6. **Angle diversity**: Call center AI / startup / infrastructure / broader AI / agent (50/50 balance)
7. **Content bucket**: Authority / Personality / Shareability (40/30/30 balance)
8. **Hook formula**: Applied one of 8 formulas? Passed 10-point checklist?
9. **Voice protocol**: Passed 7-point voice checklist? (Read aloud test)
10. **Timing**: Posting 9 AM-2 PM weekday? (Optimal engagement window)

**If any item fails → rewrite or discard.**

---

## File Naming Convention

**CRITICAL**: Use date-based naming (not week-based, becomes meaningless after posting)

**Tweets**: `tweet-YYYYMMDD-NNN.txt`
**Threads**: `thread-YYYYMMDD-NNN.txt`
**Replies**: `reply-YYYYMMDD-NNN.txt`

**Example**:
- `tweet-20260211-001.txt` (first tweet created Feb 11)
- `thread-20260211-001.txt` (first thread created Feb 11)
- `reply-20260211-001.txt` (first reply created Feb 11)

---

---

## Blockers & Escalation

**P0 Blockers** (require owner action):
1. **X Premium** ($8/mo) - BLOCKS metrics, Communities, algorithmic boost
2. **Communities join** (5 min after Premium) - BLOCKS 30,000x reach multiplier
3. **Profile optimization** (bio, pinned, banner) - BLOCKS 4x conversion improvement

**If blockers unresolved after 3 sessions**:
- Document in state file
- Create issue in repo for owner visibility
- Continue research/preparation work (don't waste sessions)

**When Premium activates**:
- Immediately execute Priority 0 (profile optimization)
- Then Priority 1 (timely content)
- Then Priority 3 (Communities strategy)

---

## Success Criteria (Know When to Pivot)

**After 10 posts (Days 1-5), evaluate:**

### Green Signals (Strategy Working)
- Follower growth: >5 followers/day (vs 0 baseline)
- Engagement rate: >0.5% (moving toward 1% target)
- Call center AI content: Outperforming agent content (angle diversity hypothesis validated)
- 0-link posts: Outperforming linked posts (pure content value hypothesis validated)
- Personality posts: Getting saves/shares (emotional resonance working)
- Communities: Driving profile visits (30,000x reach hypothesis validated)

**Action if green**: Continue execution, scale up (3 posts/session, 30 replies/day)

### Yellow Signals (Mixed Results)
- Follower growth: 1-4 followers/day (some traction, needs optimization)
- Engagement: 0.2-0.5% (algorithm learning, not suppressing but not boosting)
- Angle diversity: Unclear which angle performs best (need more data)

**Action if yellow**: Continue execution, refine based on what's working (double down on highest performers)

### Red Signals (Strategy Not Working)
- Follower growth: 0-1 followers/day (no improvement vs baseline)
- Engagement: <0.2% (algorithm suppression or content quality issues)
- Premium still not active (structural blocker unresolved)
- Communities not joined (30,000x multiplier missing)

**Action if red**:
1. Verify Premium status (without it, nothing else matters)
2. Review content quality (voice checklist, hook checklist, value test)
3. Escalate blockers to owner (create GitHub issue)
4. Pivot to engagement-only strategy (100% replies, 0% original posts until traction)

## Final Notes

**This playbook synthesizes 7 sessions of research** (Sessions #34-40) into actionable Day 1 priorities when queue < 15.

**DO NOT deviate from priorities** without evidence:
- Timely content FIRST (news hooks decay)
- Profile optimization IF NOT DONE (4x conversion multiplier)
- Corrected strategy execution (50/50 angles, 0 links 80%, personality 30%)
- Voice protocol on EVERY piece (authenticity = algorithm priority)
- Engagement 70/30 allocation (replies > original posts for growth)

**Track everything**. After 20 posts, validate hypotheses. Graduate validated patterns to skills. Remove what doesn't work.

**Speed matters**. Queue has been >15 for 7 sessions. When it clears, execute fast. Feb 2026 news won't be timely in 2 weeks.

**Evidence > intuition**. All priorities based on 25+ sources per topic, 2026 data, validated frameworks.
