# Content Templates: Corrected Strategy (Deployment-Ready)

**Date**: 2026-02-11
**Session**: #35
**Status**: Ready for execution when queue < 15
**Purpose**: Demonstrate corrected content approach (Value Rule, Angle Diversity, Content Mix)

---

## Critical Corrections from Session #34 Analysis

### Issues Identified
1. ❌ **Link saturation**: 100% of posts included repo link (should be 20%)
2. ❌ **Angle monotony**: 100% autonomous agent (should be 50% max)
3. ❌ **Content bucket imbalance**: 100% authority, 0% personality/shareability (should be balanced mix)
4. ❌ **Value Rule violation**: Mixed content + outcome value in every post

### Corrected Approach
1. ✅ **Value Rule compliance**: Pure content value (0 links) OR outcome value (with link), never both
2. ✅ **Angle diversity**: 50% call center AI / startup / infrastructure, 50% autonomous agent
3. ✅ **Content mix balance**: 40% authority, 30% personality, 30% shareability
4. ✅ **Hook engineering**: Apply 10-point checklist to every hook

## Template Set 1: Pure Content Value (0 Links)

### Template 1A: Call Center AI Authority (Our Strongest Differentiator)

**Angle**: Voice AI production insights
**Bucket**: Authority
**Hook Formula**: Contrarian + Credibility
**Target**: 0 links (pure content value)

```
ASR vendors show 95% accuracy in demos.

Deploy to production: 67%.

Here's what actually determines success in call center AI:

1) Audio quality (background noise, crosstalk, hold music)
2) Domain vocabulary (industry terms, proper nouns, acronyms)
3) Integration architecture (14 systems, zero communication)

The demo is 20% of the project. Integration is the other 80%.

(7 years, 500K+ interactions analyzed)
```

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Hook: Contrarian (95% → 67% = pattern interrupt)
- ✅ Under 110 chars first line (95 chars = "ASR vendors show 95% accuracy in demos.")
- ✅ Credibility marker: (7 years, 500K+ interactions)
- ✅ Specific, not generic: (95% → 67%, 14 systems, 80%)
- ✅ Value delivered: Insight about production reality
- ✅ NO LINK: Pure content value
- ✅ Angle: Call center AI (not autonomous agent)
- ✅ Bucket: Authority (expertise-driven)

**Character count**: ~430 chars (well under X_MAX_TWEET_LENGTH)

---

### Template 1B: Startup Lessons (15 Years Experience)

**Angle**: Founder journey insights
**Bucket**: Personality + Authority balance
**Hook Formula**: Story Hook + Vulnerability
**Target**: 0 links (pure content value)

```
Built my first startup in 2011. Built my second in 2021.

Here's what didn't transfer (and cost me 6 months):

1) Hiring for skills (2011) vs hiring for chaos tolerance (2021)
   → Early-stage needs ambiguity navigators, not specialists

2) Building features (2011) vs validating problems (2021)
   → Product-market fit isn't what you build, it's what they'll pay for

3) Perfectionism (2011) vs iteration velocity (2021)
   → Ship broken, fix fast > ship perfect, miss window

The only thing that transferred: resilience beats strategy.
```

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Hook: Transformation story (2011 → 2021 = 10-year arc)
- ✅ Vulnerability: "cost me 6 months" (admits failure)
- ✅ Authority: 15 years founder experience (2011-2026)
- ✅ Specific: 3 concrete learnings with before/after
- ✅ NO LINK: Pure content value
- ✅ Angle: Startup building (not autonomous agent)
- ✅ Bucket: Personality (30%) + Authority (70%) balance

### Template 1C: Infrastructure → AI Career Transition

**Angle**: Career journey
**Bucket**: Personality + Shareability
**Hook Formula**: Question Hook + Identity Targeting
**Target**: 0 links (pure content value)

```
Ever wonder how a network engineer ends up building Voice AI?

Here's the bridge no one talks about:

Infrastructure taught me: systems fail. Plan for it.

AI/ML taught me: models fail. Plan for it.

Production taught me: everything fails. Build for it.

The job title changed. The mindset didn't.

→ Debug distributed systems
→ Debug distributed compute
→ Debug model behavior in production

Same skills, different stack.
```

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Hook: Question (identity targeting = network engineers, career transitioners)
- ✅ Pattern interrupt: "The job title changed. The mindset didn't."
- ✅ Shareability: Relatable career transition narrative
- ✅ Personality: Behind-the-scenes thinking
- ✅ NO LINK: Pure content value
- ✅ Angle: Career transition (not autonomous agent)
- ✅ Bucket: Personality (50%) + Shareability (50%)

---

### Template 1D: Broader AI/ML Industry Commentary

**Angle**: AI industry trends
**Bucket**: Shareability + Authority
**Hook Formula**: Pattern Interrupt + Numerical
**Target**: 0 links (pure content value)

```
Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3 Codex dropped within minutes of each other.

This isn't competition. It's convergence.

What it means for agentic coding:

1) Multi-model orchestration becomes default (not single-vendor lock-in)
2) Specification Engineering > Prompt Engineering (models are commoditizing)
3) The harness matters more than the model (routing, validation, recovery)

We're entering the "boring infrastructure" phase of AI.

That's when real products get built.
```

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Hook: Pattern interrupt (convergence, not competition)
- ✅ Numerical: "Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3 Codex" (specificity)
- ✅ Timely: References current events (Feb 2026)
- ✅ Shareability: Hot take, quotable ("boring infrastructure" phase)
- ✅ Authority: Framework (Specification Engineering)
- ✅ NO LINK: Pure content value
- ✅ Angle: Broader AI trends (not autonomous agent specific)
- ✅ Bucket: Shareability (60%) + Authority (40%)

## Template Set 2: Outcome Value (Links Allowed)

### Template 2A: Autonomous Agent BIP Update

**Angle**: Autonomous agent experiment
**Bucket**: Authority
**Hook Formula**: Numerical Claim + Proof
**Target**: 1 link (outcome value, repo promotion)

```
160 PRs. Zero human intervention. 6 followers after 244 tweets.

Here's what an autonomous agent taught me that growth playbooks skip:

1) Content quality ≠ content reach (algorithm structure matters more)
2) Premium accounts get 10x reach vs free (0% median engagement on free tier)
3) Communities = 30,000x multiplier (180K members vs 6 followers)

Building in public → [repo link]

The experiment continues.
```

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Hook: Numerical (160 PRs, 0 human, 6 followers = specificity + vulnerability)
- ✅ Credibility: Specific proof (244 tweets, 10x reach, 30,000x multiplier)
- ✅ Vulnerability: "6 followers after 244 tweets" (honest about struggle)
- ✅ Authority: Insights from experience
- ✅ LINK ALLOWED: Outcome value (repo provides utility)
- ✅ Value type: OUTCOME (link to experiment repo)
- ✅ NOT mixing types: Insight is context for the repo, not standalone value
- ✅ Angle: Autonomous agent (promotional, 20% allocation)

**Character count**: ~480 chars + link

---

### Template 2B: Ender Turing Promotion (Product Outcome Value)

**Angle**: Ender Turing (product promotion)
**Bucket**: Authority
**Hook Formula**: Credibility + Promise + Results
**Target**: 1 link (outcome value, product promotion)

```
20% CSAT increase. 180 hours saved per month. 8% sales lift.

Ender Turing analyzes 500K+ call center interactions to find what drives performance.

Not sentiment scores. Behavior analytics.

Not generic dashboards. Actionable coaching.

Production AI for call centers → [Ender Turing link]
```

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Hook: Results-driven (20% CSAT, 180 hours, 8% sales = concrete outcomes)
- ✅ Credibility: 500K+ interactions (proof at scale)
- ✅ Differentiation: "Not X. Y." pattern (contrasts with competitors)
- ✅ LINK ALLOWED: Outcome value (product provides utility)
- ✅ Value type: OUTCOME (link to product)
- ✅ NOT mixing types: Results are product proof, not standalone insight
- ✅ Angle: Ender Turing (promotional, 20% allocation)

## Template Set 3: Engagement Content (Replies)

### Template 3A: Reply to Top Voice (Call Center AI Angle)

**Context**: Reply to @username discussing AI adoption in enterprise
**Angle**: Call center AI expertise
**Bucket**: Authority + Vulnerability
**Target**: 0 links (pure value in replies)

```
This. 100%.

We saw this at Ender Turing: 95% accuracy in vendor demos → 67% in production.

The gap isn't the model. It's:
→ Audio quality (hold music, background noise)
→ Domain vocabulary (industry terms vendors never trained on)
→ Integration hell (14 systems, zero communication)

AI adoption in enterprise = 20% AI, 80% change management.
```

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Builds on original post (adds value, not just "Great post!")
- ✅ Specific experience (95% → 67%, 14 systems)
- ✅ Authority + vulnerability balance
- ✅ NO LINK in reply (pure value)
- ✅ Angle: Call center AI (expertise-driven)
- ✅ Engagement multiplier: Reply-to-reply = 75x algorithm boost

---

### Template 3B: Reply to Top Voice (Startup Angle)

**Context**: Reply to @username discussing founder challenges
**Angle**: Startup lessons
**Bucket**: Personality + Shareability
**Target**: 0 links (pure value in replies)

```
Felt this hard in 2011-2013.

Built OSIS from 0 → exit. Biggest lesson: chaos tolerance > skills.

Hired infrastructure experts. Lost them in 6 months (couldn't handle ambiguity).
Hired problem-solvers. Still with us 5 years later.

Early-stage hiring: resilience > resume.
```

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Personal story (0 → exit, 6 months, 5 years = specific timeline)
- ✅ Vulnerability: "Lost them in 6 months"
- ✅ Shareability: Relatable founder struggle
- ✅ Memorable takeaway: "chaos tolerance > skills"
- ✅ NO LINK in reply
- ✅ Angle: Startup lessons (15 years experience)

## Hook Engineering Checklist (Apply to Every Post)

Before publishing any content, verify ALL items:

- [ ] **Under 110 characters?** (optimal for mobile scan)
- [ ] **Pattern interrupt?** (unexpected phrasing that breaks scroll)
- [ ] **Credibility marker?** (proof/numbers/authority in first line)
- [ ] **Curiosity gap?** (creates "I need to know" feeling)
- [ ] **Specific, not generic?** ("500K interactions" not "lots of experience")
- [ ] **Emotional trigger?** (awe, contrarian, humor — not neutral)
- [ ] **Identity targeting?** (clear who this is for)
- [ ] **Buries NO leads?** (strongest insight FIRST)
- [ ] **Avoids 2022 templates?** ("I studied X for Y. Here's what I learned" = dead)
- [ ] **Engagement driver?** (will this spark replies/shares/saves?)

---

## Content Creation Checklist (Apply to Every Post)

Before committing any content, verify ALL items:

1. **Queue check**: Is total pending queue > 15? If yes, STOP — create zero new content.
2. **Quality gate**: Would a stranger follow you based on this post alone? If not, rewrite or discard.
3. **Value type**: Is this content value OR outcome value? **Never both.** If it has a link, it's outcome value. If it has an insight, no link.
4. **Length**: Check X_MAX_TWEET_LENGTH GitHub var. Write as long as the content needs — concise and valuable (not padded).
5. **Link allocation**: Only ~20% of posts should include links. Check recent output — if last 4 posts all had links, this one must not.
6. **Angle diversity**: Is this about the autonomous agent? If your last 2 posts were also agent-focused, write about something else (call center AI, startup lessons, infrastructure, broader AI).
7. **BIP balance**: Is BIP content at least 25% of recent output? If not, make this one BIP.
8. **Category**: Authority / Personality / Shareability. Avoid imbalance — personality and shareability are chronically under-represented.
9. **Hook**: Does the first line stop the scroll? Apply hook formula.

## Timing Strategy (When to Post)

### Optimal Posting Times (2026 Research)
- **Weekday peak**: 9 AM - 2 PM (highest engagement)
- **Best window**: 10 AM - 12 PM (mid-morning focus break)
- **Avoid**: 3-5 PM (afternoon slump, low engagement)
- **Weekend peak**: 9-11 AM (lazy morning scrolling)

### Engagement Velocity Critical Window
- **First 30 minutes = make or break**
- Likes, replies, retweets in first 30 min → algorithm pushes to more people
- No engagement in first 30 min → algorithmic burial

### Manual Phase 1 Workflow (When Premium Active)
1. Repo owner reviews queue daily at 9-10 AM
2. Select top 1-2 pieces that follow frameworks
3. Post via web UI to 2-3 relevant Communities
4. Check "Also share with followers"
5. Engage with early replies (boost velocity)
