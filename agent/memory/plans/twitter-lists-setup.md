# Twitter Lists Setup: Mid-Tier Engagement Targets

**Purpose**: Curated lists of 10K-100K follower accounts for strategic reply targeting
**Evidence**: 2026 research shows mid-tier accounts = optimal reply ROI for 0-100 follower growth
**Status**: Ready for repo owner to create

## Why Twitter Lists?

### The Problem
- Scrolling "For You" is random and time-consuming
- Finding fresh posts (2-6h old) from good targets is manual labor
- No systematic approach = inconsistent execution

### The Solution
- Twitter Lists = curated feeds of specific accounts
- Check lists 2x daily (morning + evening)
- Fresh posts from proven targets, zero noise

### The ROI
- **Time savings**: 5 min to find 10 reply targets (vs. 20 min scrolling)
- **Higher quality**: Pre-vetted accounts that engage with replies
- **Consistency**: Same proven targets every day = compound relationship building

- Changed content focus (no longer relevant)

### Add New Accounts:
- Found via reply chain mining
- Recommended by accounts you engage with
- Discovered via search for trending topics in your niche

**Goal**: Keep lists fresh, 20-30 accounts per list

- Some list accounts may follow you back
- Expected: 100-150 new followers/week

### Weeks 9-12
- Established presence in these communities
- Reply-to-reply engagement drives algorithm boost

## Success Metrics

### Track Weekly:
- Replies posted from lists: [target 140-210/week]
- Profile visits (from X analytics): [target 100-300/week]
- New followers: [target 20-50/week early, 100-150/week by week 8]
- Reply engagement: [likes/replies on YOUR replies, target 3-5 per reply]

### Qualitative Signals:
- List accounts replying to YOUR replies (recognition building)
- List accounts following you back
- DMs from list accounts (relationship deepening)
- List accounts retweeting your original posts (network effect kicking in)

---

## Integration with Original Content

### The Compound Effect
- Replies drive profile visits
- Profile visits see your original posts
- Original posts convert visitors to followers
- Followers engage with future posts
- Higher engagement = algorithm boost
- More reach = more growth

**The mistake**: Treating replies and original posts as separate activities.
**The fix**: Replies ARE the top-of-funnel. Original posts convert.

### Content Mix (Daily)
- **Morning**: 1 original post + 5-8 replies from lists
- **Evening**: 5-8 replies from lists
- **Total**: 1 original post, 10-16 replies

**Evidence**: "A person posting 3x and replying 30x will outgrow someone posting 10x with no engagement." - Graham Mann, 2026

- Success metrics defined
- Reply frameworks ready (see `2026-02-10-reply-strategy-evidence.md`)

### ⏳ Waiting On:
- Queue < 15 (currently 35)
- Repo owner to create lists on X
- Deployment clearance

### 🚀 When Deploying:
1. Repo owner creates 4 lists on X (5 min setup)
2. Agent uses lists to find reply targets (via web search for tweet IDs)
