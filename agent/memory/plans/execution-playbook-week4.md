# Week 4+ Execution Playbook
**Created:** 2026-02-09
**Purpose:** Consolidated action plan synthesizing 4 sessions of preparation work (PR#116-119)

## Current Status (Week 3 End)

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Followers | 6 | 4,994 from goal |
| Posted content | 77 total (44 tweets, 31 replies, 2 threads) | High volume |
| Pending queue | 47 items | **Above 15 cap — content freeze active** |
| Sessions run | 35+ | High activity |
| Follower velocity | 0.75/day | Need 39x improvement |
| ETA at current pace | ~18 years | Strategy change required |

## P0 Blocker: X Premium ($8/month)

**Why critical:**
- Free accounts have **0% median engagement** (Buffer study, 18.8M posts, 2026)
- Premium delivers **10x reach** (600 vs <100 impressions/post)
- Reply boost: 30-40% higher visibility, appear at top of threads
- Community posting requires Premium

**Without Premium, all content creation is likely futile.**

Owner action needed: Subscribe at x.com/settings/premium

## Phase 1: Foundation (Owner Actions — ~1 hour total)

### 1. Subscribe to X Premium ($8/month)
- Go to x.com/settings/premium
- Choose Premium or Premium+ plan
- This unlocks all other tactics

### 2. Optimize Profile (15 minutes)
See `agent/memory/plans/profile-action-plan.md` for complete guide.

**Bio:** Update to recommended version (from bio-optimization.md)

**Pinned tweet:** Post thread from `agent/memory/plans/pinned-tweet-draft.md`
- Option B (3-tweet thread) recommended
- Tells journey story, showcases Ender Turing results, links experiment

**Banner:** Design or commission from brief in `agent/memory/plans/banner-design-brief.md`
- 1500x500px, Canva DIY (30 min) or freelancer ($20-50)
- Impact: 30% more profile visits

### 3. Join Communities (15 minutes)
From `agent/memory/plans/x-communities-to-join.md`:

**Priority 1 (must join):**
- Build in Public (243.5K members) — primary target
- Generative AI (238K members)
- Startup Community (93K members)

**Priority 2 (recommended):**
- Software Engineering (132K)
- AI Builders & Founders (varies)

**Why:** Case study shows 2,000 followers in 30 days with 100% community posting. Community posts now visible to ALL X users (2026 update), not just members.

## Phase 2: Content Restart (Once Queue < 15 AND Premium Active)

### New Content Rules (Updated from Week 3 Retro)

#### Volume Caps
1. **Queue check:** If pending > 15, create ZERO new content
2. **Max 2 pieces per session** (tweets, threads, replies combined)
3. **Max 5 pending replies** at any time (timeliness critical)

#### Quality Gate
Before committing any content: **"Would a stranger follow me based on this post alone?"**
If no, rewrite or discard.

#### Value Type Rule
**Never mix content value + outcome value in one post.**

- **Content value:** The post itself teaches or provokes thought (no link)
- **Outcome value:** The link gives reader something useful (tool, repo, resource)

Target: **Only 20% of posts include links.** Other 80% = pure content value.

Week 3 mistake: 100% of posts included repo link → looks spammy, hurts algorithmic reach.

#### Content Angle Diversity
**Max 50% about the autonomous agent.**
Other 50% draws on author's broader expertise:

- Call center AI / speech analytics (Ender Turing domain)
- Startup building and scaling (15+ years experience)
- Infrastructure architecture journey (network eng → AI)
- Broader AI/ML trends and industry analysis
- Product development insights

Week 3 mistake: Every post connected back to "PDCA cycles, X PRs shipped" → reads as single-topic bot.

#### 3-Bucket Balance
Rotate between content types:

| Bucket | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Authority | Build credibility | Frameworks, how-tos, insights |
| Personality | Build connection | Stories, opinions, behind-scenes |
| Shareability | Expand reach | Hot takes, relatable moments |

Week 3 imbalance: Authority + BIP dominated. Little personality or shareability.

## Phase 3: Engagement Strategy (Premium Required)

### Target: Mid-Tier Accounts (10K-100K followers)

**Why mid-tier beats mega-accounts:**
- Week 3 evidence: 31 replies to 200K-4.2M accounts = +1 follower
- Research: Mid-tier accounts (10K-100K) have higher reply visibility
- Less competition in replies, higher chance of being seen

**Framework:** See `agent/memory/research/2026-02-09-midtier-accounts-targets.md`

**50 account categories identified:**
- AI builders and indie hackers
- Bootstrapped founders and SaaS founders
- ML researchers and practitioners
- Developer advocates
- Technical bloggers

**Weekly rotation protocol:** Engage with 10-15 different accounts per week to avoid spam appearance.

### Comment Templates

**7 template categories** (from `agent/memory/research/2026-02-09-comment-templates.md`):

1. **Agreement + Extension:** "Great point. I'd add that [insight]..."
2. **Add Examples:** "Ran into this exact problem. What worked was..."
3. **Contrarian (Respectful):** "Interesting take. I've seen the opposite because..."
4. **Ask Sharp Questions:** "Curious about X — have you seen it work at scale?"
5. **Add Data/Evidence:** "We tested this — saw 3x improvement when..."
6. **Connect Dots:** "This pairs well with [other person]'s point about..."
7. **Build on Idea:** "Building on your point, [extension]..."

**Quality checklist:**
- Would someone follow me based on this reply alone?
- Does it add value, not just agreement?
- Is it specific to what they actually said?
- Is it conversational, not promotional?

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Empty agreement ("Great post!", "So true!")
- Self-promotion without context ("Check out my thing!")
- Generic responses that could apply anywhere
- Formulaic pattern: [their point] → [agent angle] → [repo link]

### Reply Timeliness Rule

**Only reply to posts < 24 hours old.**

Algorithm prioritizes first 30 minutes. Replies posted hours/days later get buried.

Week 3 mistake: Replies queued and posted 24-48+ hours after original → near-zero visibility.

**If reply queue > 5: create ZERO new replies.** Let them drain first. Stale reply is worse than no reply.

### Session Allocation (< 100 followers)

When Premium active and queue < 15:
- **50% of session time:** Find and create replies to mid-tier accounts
- **50% of session time:** Create original content
- **Target output:** 1 original post + 1 reply per session (max 2 total)

## Phase 4: Community Posting Strategy (Premium + Communities Joined)

From `agent/memory/research/2026-02-09-x-communities-strategy.md`:

### Build in Public Community (243.5K members)

**Primary target.** Case study: 2,000 followers in 30 days with 100% community posting.

**What to post:**
- Session updates and learnings
- PR milestones and metrics
- Behind-the-scenes (state file snippets, PDCA cycles)
- Failures and pivots (authenticity builds trust)
- Skill development journey
- Surprising findings from research

**Posting cadence:**
- 1 community post per session (when creating content)
- Rotate between 3-5 communities to maximize reach
- Always cross-post to main profile (communities boost main profile visibility)

**Content voice:**
- Frame as "human building products with autonomous tools"
- Use: creating, building, generating, exploring, shipping
- Avoid: testing, experimenting, trying (sounds uncertain)
- Story is human innovation, not AI replacement

### Community Engagement

- Reply to other members' community posts (builds relationships)
- Celebrate others' wins (reciprocity drives follows)
- Ask questions in communities (drives replies, replies drive reach)

---

## Phase 5: Metrics & Iteration

### Metrics to Track (Manual Until API Access)

From owner's X analytics (x.com/home/analytics):

| Metric | Target | Why it matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Engagement rate | >1% | Measures content quality |
| Impressions/post | >600 | Algorithmic reach indicator |
| Profile visits | Growing | Interest in following |
| Follower growth | >1/day sustained | Progress toward 5,000 goal |
| Reply engagement | Track separately | Reply-to-reply conversion rate |

### Weekly Review

Every Sunday retro:
1. Compare metrics to previous week
2. Identify top-performing content (what pattern?)
3. Identify low-performing content (what to avoid?)
4. Adjust content strategy based on data
5. Update skills if patterns emerge

### Hypothesis Testing

Continue testing and validating:

| Hypothesis | Status | Next step |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Premium is prerequisite | Confirmed (research) | Test with subscription |
| Communities = instant distribution | New | Test once Premium + joined |
| 50 comments/day drives growth | New | Test once Premium active |
| Mid-tier targeting > mega-accounts | New | Test vs Week 3 mega-account approach |
| Quality > quantity (2 pieces/session) | New | Test vs Week 3 volume approach |

## Phase 6: Long-Term Scaling (100-1000 followers)

### Community Leadership
- Start helping others in communities
- Answer questions, give feedback
- Become a recognized community voice

### Content Evolution
- Introduce threads for deeper topics (3-5 tweets max)
- Test different content buckets (authority, personality, shareability)
- Develop signature content style

### Networking
- Build relationships with mid-tier accounts through consistent engagement
- Collaborate: guest posts, shared threads, cross-promotion
- Join relevant X Spaces as speaker

### Product-Led Growth
- If Ender Turing or other products gain traction, leverage for social proof
- Customer stories and testimonials as content
- Product updates and launches

## Execution Priority (Post-Premium)

**Week 4 priorities (in order):**

1. ✅ **Queue drain to < 15** (already in progress)
2. ⏳ **Owner: Subscribe to Premium** (P0 blocker)
3. ⏳ **Owner: Profile optimization** (bio, pinned, banner, communities)
4. **Agent: Resume content creation** with new rules (quality > quantity)
5. **Agent: Test community posting** (Build in Public focus)
6. **Agent: Test mid-tier engagement** (10K-100K accounts, <24h timeliness)
7. **Owner: Provide weekly metrics** (engagement rate, impressions, profile visits)
8. **Agent: Weekly retro** with data-driven adjustments

---

## Critical Success Factors

**This execution plan only works if:**

1. **Premium is active** — Without it, free account = 0% engagement
2. **Queue stays < 15** — Volume control prevents stale content
3. **Quality gate enforced** — "Would someone follow based on this alone?"
4. **Timeliness maintained** — Replies < 24h old, posted quickly
5. **Content diversified** — Not every post about the autonomous agent
6. **Value types separated** — 20% promotional, 80% pure content value
7. **Metrics tracked** — Can't optimize what isn't measured

**If any of these factors are missing, the strategy will fail.**

## Questions or Blockers?

**For repo owner:**
If any of the owner actions in Phase 1 are unclear or blocked, flag them in the next session or via GitHub discussion. The agent can provide more detail on any component of this playbook.

**For agent (next sessions):**
If execution deviates from this plan, document WHY in the session retrospective. Plans are hypotheses — adjust based on reality, but always document the reasoning.
