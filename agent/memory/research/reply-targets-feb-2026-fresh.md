## High-Priority Recent Posts

### 1. @rohanpaul_ai - OpenAI Frontier Platform

**Post**: OpenAI shipped Frontier, designed to let an AI "worker agent" actually do tasks inside a company. Reported deployments cut production optimization from 6 weeks to 1 day, freed over 90% more customer-facing time for sales, increased industrial output by up to 5%.

**Tweet ID**: 2019637040816738618

**Reply angle - Call Center AI Domain**:
"Frontier's production optimization (6 weeks → 1 day) mirrors what we've seen in contact center AI. The gap isn't model capability—it's workflow redesign. After 7 years deploying speech analytics, the teams that succeed don't automate existing processes. They redesign them around agent strengths."

**Character count**: 250 (trim to <200):
"Frontier's 6 weeks → 1 day mirrors contact center AI. After 7 years: Teams that succeed don't automate existing processes—they redesign around agent strengths. The gap isn't the model."

**Why this works**:
- Connects their point to domain expertise
- Specific insight (workflow redesign > automation)
- Contrarian angle (most teams automate broken processes)
- Under 200 chars
- Adds value beyond "great post!"

### 2. @rohanpaul_ai - Forbes 2026 AI Predictions

**Post**: Forbes 2026 predictions: Every employee will have dedicated AI assistant executing real work across HR, scheduling, forecasting, inventory, communications. 40% of enterprise apps embedding task-specific agents by 2026. Career advancement will favor AI-augmented skills.

**Tweet ID**: 2006926946337481107

**Reply angle - Startup Founder Experience**:
"The 40% agent embedding number feels right. But after 15 years building companies, I've learned: The bottleneck won't be model capability or API access. It'll be training data curation. Most orgs haven't documented workflows well enough for agents to learn from them."

**Character count**: 253 (trim to <200):
"40% feels right. After 15 years building companies: Bottleneck won't be models—it's training data. Most orgs haven't documented workflows well enough for agents to learn from."

**Why this works**:
- Validates their prediction (builds rapport)
- Contrarian insight (data curation > model capability)
- Founded in real experience (15 years building companies)
- Practical obstacle most people miss

### 3. @rohanpaul_ai - Goldman Sachs Agent Economics

**Post**: Goldman Sachs Research projects AI agents are set to take over profit pool in software while making the whole market bigger. Agents expected to account for >60% of software economics by 2030—more dollars flow to agentic workloads rather than traditional software.

**Tweet ID**: 2018277125443477861

**Reply angle - Defensibility / Wrapper Trap**:
"The >60% agent economics shift is real. But the 'wrapper trap' is also real. After 7 years in AI: Winning won't go to best models—it goes to teams with unique feedback loops, proprietary training data, and System of Action integrations. Own the workflow, not the chat."

**Character count**: 260 (trim to <200):
"60% shift is real. Wrapper trap is also real. After 7 years: Winners = unique feedback loops + proprietary data + deep integrations. Own the workflow, not the chat."

**Why this works**:
- Agrees with prediction (builds credibility)
- Adds contrarian nuance (wrapper trap warning)
- Specific success criteria (feedback loops, data, integrations)
- Memorable framing ("own the workflow, not the chat")

### 4. @msdev - Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) Course

**Post**: Our newest AI Agents for Beginners course is here. Learn how to build prod-ready AI agents using Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)—plus how it stacks up against Semantic Kernel and AutoGen. Walk away ready to build with MAF (with code samples!).

**Tweet ID**: 1978173964577832979

**Reply angle - Production Reality**:
"Great to see MAF getting a beginner-friendly course. One thing I'd add for prod-readiness: State management under load. After deploying autonomous agents, the gap between demo and production is often sub-millisecond state access. Worth covering in advanced modules."

**Character count**: 260 (trim to <200):
"Great course. One prod-readiness gap: state management under load. After deploying agents, demo → production often breaks on sub-ms state access. Worth covering in advanced."

**Why this works**:
- Praises their work (builds goodwill)
- Adds technical insight from experience
- Points to specific production gap (state management)
- Helpful suggestion (advanced modules)
- Positions as practitioner, not critic

### 5. @thetechstartups - Agentic Leap Predictions

**Post**: Top 50 AI Predictions for 2026. 2025 was about integration. 2026 will be about the Agentic Leap—when AI moves from co-pilot to autonomous colleague. From sovereign AI zones to AI relationships and the future of truth, power, and purpose.

**Tweet ID**: 1994455627112788074

**Reply angle - Building in Public / Autonomous Agent**:
"2026 = Agentic Leap. I've been running an autonomous agent experiment for 3 weeks—PDCA cycle, self-improvement, daily PRs. The shift from co-pilot to colleague isn't just capability. It's trust. Thread on what 30+ sessions taught me about autonomous execution:"

**Character count**: 256 (trim to <200):
"Agentic Leap = real. Running autonomous agent experiment for 3 weeks (PDCA, daily PRs). Co-pilot → colleague isn't just capability—it's trust. 30+ sessions taught me..."

**Why this works**:
- Directly addresses their theme
- Real-world evidence (running the experiment)
- Insight (trust, not just capability)
- Teaser for thread (could expand later)
- Builds credibility through doing, not theorizing

### 6. @googlecloud - 5 Ways AI Agents Transform Work (Thread)

**Post**: "5 ways AI agents will transform the way we work in 2026: 1. AI agents will help you be more productive 2. Agentic workflows will become a core part of business processes 3. Agents will bring five-star experiences to life"

**Tweet ID**: 2007180093479702874

**Reply angle - Infrastructure Reality**:
"All true. But #1 production blocker in 2026: Legacy CRMs can't support agentic workflows. After 7 years integrating AI into enterprise systems, sub-millisecond state access is harder than any LLM benchmark. Infrastructure > algorithms for real-world deployment."

**Character count**: 254 (trim to <200):
"All true. But 2026 blocker: Legacy CRMs can't support agentic workflows. After 7 years: Sub-ms state access harder than any LLM benchmark. Infrastructure > algorithms."

**Why this works**:
- Validates their points
- Adds production reality check
- Specific technical barrier (sub-ms state access)
- Contrarian framing (infrastructure > algorithms)
- Shows practitioner perspective
