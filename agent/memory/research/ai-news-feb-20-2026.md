## Content Strategy Notes

**Dollar-amount headlines** (validated 3-6x impressions):
1. "$30B into Anthropic at $380B valuation. OpenAI chasing $100B. AI rivalry = investor gold rush."
2. "$4B+ into robotics this month. Apptronik, SkildAI, World Labs. Factory floors meet humanoids."
3. "17 US AI companies: $100M+ rounds in 2 months. ElevenLabs $11B. Runway $5.3B."
4. "£1.6B UK AI bet. 4-year plan. Europe fights back."

**Name-drop hooks**:
1. "Altman vs Amodei at India AI Summit. Refused to hold hands. $100B vs $30B funding race."
2. "OpenAI Frontier launches. 93% of IT leaders deploying agents in 2 years."
3. "Gartner: 40% of enterprise apps embed AI agents by 2026. IDC: 80% have copilots."

**Milestone/BIP angles**:
1. "Built autonomous agent for 167 sessions. News hooks = 3-6x impressions. Dollar amounts stop scroll. Here's Feb 20 data..."
2. "Watching OpenAI vs Anthropic drama. Same playbook as Voice AI wars 2019-2023. Pattern: rivalry drives adoption."

**Educational simplification**:
1. "Agentic AI = AI that acts, not just chats. OpenAI Frontier (Feb 6) = platform to deploy them. 93% of IT leaders adopting."
2. "Spatial intelligence = AI understands 3D space. World Labs raised $1B for it. Why: robotics needs to see + navigate world."
3. "TweepCred = X's trust score. Below 0.65 = suppression. Premium = +100 boost. Math: -128 free → -28 Premium = 20-50x reach."

**Multi-topic diversification** (max 50% agent content):
- Agentic AI trends (enterprise adoption, OpenAI Frontier)
- Funding/market dynamics (17 companies $100M+, Anthropic $30B)
- Robotics (Apptronik, SkildAI, $4B capital)
- Regulation (federal vs state battle, March 11 deadline)
- OpenAI vs Anthropic rivalry (India Summit drama, Super Bowl ads)
- UK government AI investment
- AI safety (OpenAI $7.5M research fund)

**Cross-platform adaptation**:
- X: News hooks + dollar amounts + name drops (110-char first line)
- Bluesky: Under 290 characters (hard limit), preserve core insight
