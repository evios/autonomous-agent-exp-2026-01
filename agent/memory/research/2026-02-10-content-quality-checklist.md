# Content Quality Checklist — 2026 Execution Standards

**Purpose:** Pre-flight checklist for every content piece. Created 2026-02-10 from synthesis of all research.

**Context:** After 215 tweets + 31 replies = 6 followers, quality must be ruthlessly high. One great tweet beats five mediocre ones.

---

## Pre-Creation Checklist

### 1. Queue Gate (HARD STOP)
- [ ] **Total pending queue < 15?** If NO → STOP. Create ZERO content.
- [ ] **Session content count < 2?** If NO → STOP. Max 2 pieces per session.
- [ ] **Reply queue < 5?** If NO and creating reply → STOP. Timeliness critical.

### 2. Quality Gate (Would a stranger follow you?)
- [ ] **Hook test:** Does first line stop the scroll? (See Hook Engineering below)
- [ ] **Value test:** Would YOU save/share this? If not → rewrite or discard.
- [ ] **Uniqueness test:** Could anyone else have written this? If YES → add personal angle.
- [ ] **Clarity test:** Can you understand the core idea in 5 seconds? If NO → simplify.

### 3. Value Type (NEVER MIX)
- [ ] **Content value OR outcome value?** Pick ONE.
  - Content value = insight/explanation/story (NO links)
  - Outcome value = promotion/tool/resource (link required)
- [ ] **If outcome value:** Is the thing being promoted genuinely useful? Not just self-serving?

### 4. Link Allocation (20% Target)
- [ ] **Check last 5 posts:** How many had links?
  - 0-1 links → OK to include link if outcome value
  - 2+ links → NO link allowed this post
- [ ] **If including link:** Is it insight-driven? Does it solve reader's problem?

### 5. Angle Diversity (50% Non-Agent Rule)
- [ ] **Check last 3 posts:** How many were about autonomous agent?
  - 0-1 posts → OK to write about agent
  - 2+ posts → MUST write about different angle
- [ ] **Angle options when diversifying:**
  - Founder journey & lessons (15+ years OSIS + Ender Turing)
  - Call center AI / production challenges (Ender Turing domain)
  - Infrastructure→AI career transition (network eng → NLP research)
  - Broader AI/ML trends & discourse (Feb 2026 themes)

### 6. Bucket Balance (Authority / Personality / Shareability)
- [ ] **Check last 5 posts:** Count by bucket
  - All authority? → Create personality or shareability
  - All personality? → Create authority or shareability
  - All shareability? → Create authority or personality
- [ ] **Target distribution:** 40% authority, 35% personality, 25% shareability

### 7. Length & Format
- [ ] **Check X_MAX_TWEET_LENGTH var** (default 25000 for Premium, but verify)
- [ ] **Write as long as needed** (concise + valuable, not padded)
- [ ] **Thread rules:**
  - HARD MAX: 5 tweets per thread
  - Each tweet <250 chars (prefer <200)
  - Hook must be exceptional (threads = 10x impressions, 3x engagement)

## Hook Engineering (First Line = Everything)

**2026 Algorithm:** First 30 minutes determines viral potential. Hook determines if anyone reads past first line.

**Hook Formula:** Bold Statement + Tension + Credibility

### Proven Hook Patterns

| Pattern | Example | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Specific numbers** | "I went from 6 to 1,000 followers in 47 days. Here's exactly how." | Authority content, data-driven insights |
| **Contrarian** | "Most founders are wrong about AI integration. Here's why." | Hot takes, challenging assumptions |
| **Story opener** | "Last week our AI model failed in production. The failure taught us more than 100 successful deploys." | Personality content, vulnerability |
| **Question** | "Why do 95% of call center AI pilots fail?" | Shareability, engagement drivers |
| **Hard truth** | "Nobody tells you this about fundraising in 2026:" | Authority content, founder lessons |
| **Specific learning** | "I spent $50K learning AI deployment. Here's everything I learned (so you don't have to)." | Authority content, value promises |
| **Personal evolution** | "I used to think X. After 7 years in call center AI, I now think Y. Here's what changed..." | Personality content, expertise journey |
| **Surprising finding** | "After analyzing 10,000 customer calls, the biggest surprise wasn't what customers said — it was what they didn't say." | Authority content, domain insights |

### Hook Anti-Patterns (NEVER USE)

❌ "I want to share my thoughts on..."
❌ "Here's an interesting article about..."
❌ "Just wondering what people think about..."
❌ "Quick thread on [generic topic]"
❌ "Today I learned..." (without specificity)

## 2026 Algorithm Awareness

### What X Rewards (Evidence-Based)

| Factor | Impact | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Engagement velocity (first 30 min)** | PRIMARY ranking factor | [Grok algorithm 2026](https://grahammann.net/blog/how-to-grow-on-x-twitter-2026) |
| **Reply-to-reply chains** | 75x multiplier | [Algorithm weights](https://www.tweetarchivist.com/how-twitter-algorithm-works-2025) |
| **Conversation depth** | Worth more than hundreds of likes | [2026 ranking changes](https://typefully.com/x-algorithm-open-source) |
| **Quality over quantity** | 1 great tweet > 5 mediocre | [Small account growth](https://socialrails.com/blog/how-to-grow-on-twitter-x-complete-guide) |
| **Threads** | 3x engagement, 40-60% more reach | [Thread strategy](https://www.tweetarchivist.com/how-to-write-viral-tweets-2025) |
| **Tone (positive/constructive)** | Boosted by Grok | [Grok tone detection](https://brand24.com/blog/twitter-tips/) |
| **Small account surfacing** | Deliberate algorithm emphasis | [2026 changes](https://grahammann.net/blog/how-to-grow-on-x-twitter-2026) |

**Engagement weights:**
- Likes × 1
- Retweets × 20
- Replies × 13.5
- Profile Clicks × 12
- Link Clicks × 11
- Bookmarks × 10

### What Hurts Reach

❌ **External links** (algorithm downgrades — save for outcome-value posts only)
❌ **Heavy hashtags** (2-3 max, zero in main content)
❌ **Posting and leaving** (no engagement = dead tweet)
❌ **High volume, low engagement rate** (algorithm penalizes)
❌ **Rage-bait tone** (Grok throttles negative content)

## Content Type Decision Tree

### 1. Choose Value Type
- **Content value** → Insight, explanation, story, observation
- **Outcome value** → Tool, repo, resource, promotion

### 2. Choose Bucket
- **Authority** → Framework, how-to, analysis, data-driven insight
- **Personality** → Story, vulnerability, journey, behind-scenes
- **Shareability** → Question, hot take, relatable moment, poll

### 3. Choose Angle (Diversification Rule: Max 50% Agent)
- **Autonomous agent experiment** (25%)
- **Founder journey & lessons** (25%)
- **Call center AI / Ender Turing domain** (25%)
- **Infrastructure→AI transition / broader AI trends** (25%)

### 4. Choose Format
- **Single tweet** → Quick insight, observation, question (most common)
- **Thread (3-5 tweets)** → Deep explanation, framework, story (1x/week max)

---

## Writing Guidelines

### Language
- **Use second-person** ("you," "your") → 30-50% engagement increase
- **Be specific** → Numbers, names, concrete examples
- **Show evolution** → "I used to think... now I think..."
- **Add credibility** → "After 7 years..." / "After analyzing 10,000 calls..."

### Voice (Human Building with AI)
✅ creating, building, generating, exploring, shipping, launching
✅ product, tool, solution (never "content")
❌ testing, experimenting, trying (passive/uncertain)
❌ "I'm an AI agent" (breaks human-building-with-AI frame)

### Structure
- **Hook** (first line) → Stop the scroll
- **Value** (middle) → Deliver on promise
- **CTA** (optional) → Follow, share, or link (only if outcome value)

---

## Pre-Submit Final Check

### Quality Bar
- [ ] **Would you follow this account based on this post alone?** If NO → rewrite or discard.
- [ ] **Does this add value nobody else is providing?** If NO → add unique angle.
- [ ] **Is the hook compelling?** Test against hook patterns above.
- [ ] **Is tone positive/constructive?** (Grok rewards, rage-bait throttled)

### Technical Check
- [ ] **File naming:** `{type}-{YYYYMMDD}-{NNN}.txt`
- [ ] **Length:** Under X_MAX_TWEET_LENGTH
- [ ] **Thread format (if applicable):** `---` separators, each tweet <250 chars

### Strategic Check
- [ ] **All 7 checklist items above passed?**
- [ ] **Logged reasoning for angle choice, value type, bucket?**
- [ ] **Checked last 5 posts for diversity?**

---

## Post-Creation Learning

After each post is live (check `agent/outputs/x/posted/`):
1. **Note what hook pattern was used**
2. **Track which angle/bucket it belonged to**
3. **Once metrics available, correlate performance with these patterns**
4. **Update hypotheses in state file based on evidence**
