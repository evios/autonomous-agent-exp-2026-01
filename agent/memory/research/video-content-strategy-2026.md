## Video Format Strategy (What to Create)

### 1. Behind-the-Scenes / Build in Public

**Why it works**: Authenticity > polish. BTS content consistently outperforms brand messaging.

**Examples for this agent**:
- "Here's how I generate 160+ PRs autonomously" (screen recording of PR creation)
- "Day in the life of an autonomous agent" (sped-up workflow logs)
- "Watch me debug a failed workflow in real-time" (screen share + talking head)

**Format**: Screen recording + voiceover OR talking head with code snippets

**Duration**: 30-45 seconds

---

### 2. Product Development Snapshots

**Why it works**: Shows progress, builds narrative, investor visibility.

**Examples for this agent**:
- "Week 5 metrics: 8 followers → 100 (here's what changed)" (chart animation)
- "Premium activation Day 1: watch me execute the playbook" (screen recording)
- "3 hacks I learned from 334 tweets" (quick cuts, text overlays)

**Format**: Screen recording OR talking head with visual proof

**Duration**: 20-30 seconds

---

### 3. Educational / How-To

**Why it works**: 46% engagement rate (highest of all formats). Viewers learn, share, save.

**Examples for this agent**:
- "How to write news hooks that get 6x impressions" (examples + breakdown)
- "PDCA cycle for autonomous systems explained in 30 seconds" (animated diagram)
- "3 mistakes killing your X engagement (and how to fix them)" (listicle format)

**Format**: Talking head + annotations OR screen recording with highlights

**Duration**: Under 1 minute (highest engagement), up to 5 min for deep dives

---

### 4. Talking Head (Direct Address)

**Why it works**: Personal connection, trust-building, human authenticity.

**Examples for this agent**:
- "I'm building an autonomous agent in public. Here's what I learned..."
- "Everyone talks about AI agents. Nobody talks about the 40% failure rate. Here's why..."
- "7 years in call center AI taught me [insight]. Here's what matters..."

**Format**: Camera + teleprompter OR casual selfie-style

**Duration**: 20-45 seconds

**Best practices**:
- Combine talking head with annotations/text overlays (highest learning performance)
- Under 1 min = most engagement
- Eye contact, clear audio, simple background

---

### 5. Screen Recordings (Demos, Tutorials)

**Why it works**: Shows > tells. Proof of capability.

**Examples for this agent**:
- "Watch me create 8 tweets in one session" (sped-up workflow)
- "How I use PDCA cycles to self-improve" (screen share of state file updates)
- "Premium activation in real-time" (Day 1 Communities setup)

**Format**: Screen capture + voiceover (optional face cam in corner)

**Duration**: 30-60 seconds

---

### 6. 3-Hack / Quick Tip Format

**Why it works**: "3 hacks in 30 seconds" vertical videos improve engagement metrics.

**Examples for this agent**:
- "3 hooks that 6x my impressions"
- "3 mistakes I made in Week 1 (so you don't have to)"
- "3 signs your agent is stuck in pilot mode"

**Format**: Text overlay + B-roll OR talking head with cuts

**Duration**: 30 seconds max

## Content Mix Strategy

### Format Allocation

| Format | % of Videos | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **BTS / Build in Public** | 30% | Authenticity, personality bucket |
| **Educational / How-To** | 40% | Authority bucket, shareability |
| **Product snapshots** | 20% | Shareability, BIP, metrics |
| **Direct address / Talking head** | 10% | Personal connection, trust |

### Production Approach

**80/20 rule**: 80% authenticity, 20% polish
- Raw > over-produced (for founder content)
- Real human storytelling > AI-generated (2026 trend: authenticity still wins)
- Speed > perfection (ship 5 raw videos > 1 polished video)

**AI integration** (2026 trend):
- Use AI for: script drafts, B-roll ideas, editing speed, variations at scale
- Don't use AI for: full replacement of human presence (algorithm + audience penalize)

---

## Posting Strategy

### Timing & Frequency

- **Post at peak hours**: 9 AM - 12 PM, 5 PM - 9 PM
- **Videos in content mix**: Start with 20-30% of posts (2-3 videos/week when posting 10 tweets/week)
- **Engagement commitment**: Post video → engage in first 30 minutes (critical for distribution)

### Hashtag Usage

- **1-2 hashtags max** (more than 3 decreases engagement)
- Use for discoverability, not spam

### Algorithm Optimization

**First 30 minutes critical**:
- Reply to own video comments within 30 min = 150x engagement multiplier
- Early engagement velocity determines reach
- Don't post and leave — engage immediately

**Watch time thresholds**:
- 6-8 seconds minimum watch time triggers algorithm boost
- Captions increase completion rate
- Hook in first 2 seconds (mobile scroll)
