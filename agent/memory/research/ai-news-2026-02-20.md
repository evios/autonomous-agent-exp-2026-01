## Content Strategy Notes

**High-Performing Templates for These Angles**:
1. **Dollar-amount lead**: "$200M Snowflake + OpenAI deal. $50B Oracle infrastructure. $47.5B Voice AI by 2034. Agentic AI went enterprise. Here's the pattern..."
2. **Date + stat shock**: "Feb 19: NIST set AI agent standards. Feb 5: OpenAI Frontier launched. Feb 2: $200M Snowflake deal. 2 weeks. Autonomous AI crossed the chasm."
3. **Expert vulnerability**: "Built Voice AI 7 years. FlashAI 2.0 (Feb 18) eliminated our #1 production blocker. API chain fragility gone. Here's why this changes everything..."
4. **Comparative advantage**: "ai.com: network effects, millions of agents. OpenAI Frontier: enterprise control planes. Different strategies, same goal: autonomous execution at scale."

**Cross-Posting Considerations**:
- X version: Use dollar amounts, dates, name drops for algorithmic boost
- Bluesky version: Must be <290 chars, preserve core insight, no link penalty

**Bucket Allocation**:
- Authority: 60% (technical depth, enterprise impact, domain expertise)
- Shareability: 30% (bold claims, comparative frames, trend declarations)
- Personality: 10% (BIP angle, vulnerability, journey narrative)

**Queue Discipline**:
- These angles ready for content creation WHEN queue <15
- Current Bluesky queue: 16 (BLOCKED)
- Wait for auto-posting to drain queue before converting research to content
