## Deployment Notes

**When queue <15:**
- Use 5-8 of these angles (not all 10)
- Prioritize: Dollar amounts, name drops, timeliness (Feb 19/23 dates)
- Mix domains (don't do all funding or all product launches)
- Each piece = X file + Bluesky file (same filename)
- Bluesky version: <290 characters

**Evidence-Based Prioritization:**
- Anthropic $30B (funding + dollar amount)
- GPT-5.3 Codex (product + speed + competitive timing)
- Opus 4.6 (agentic AI trend + multi-agent)
- iOS 26.4 Gemini Siri (integration + near-term Feb 23)
- STAR-001 medical (timeliness = today, Feb 19)
- Neuromorphic (hardware efficiency breakthrough)
- Agentic AI 2026 consensus (trend validation)
- OpenAI ads (business model shift)

**Lower priority** (still valuable but less hook-y):
- India summit (policy, less concrete)
- Davos ROI focus (older, Jan 20)

---
