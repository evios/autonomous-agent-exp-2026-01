## Deployment Checklist (When Queue <15)

Before creating content from these angles:

1. **Queue verified** - Both X and Bluesky <15
2. **Freshness check** - Prioritize Feb 19, Feb 17, Feb 11-12 dates over Jan 20
3. **Domain diversity** - Max 1-2 from same domain
4. **Bucket balance** - Check last 4-5 posts for Authority/Personality/Shareability distribution
5. **Link allocation** - Only ~20% include links (most = pure content value)
6. **Angle diversity** - Max 50% about autonomous agents (use SaaSpocalypse, MRI, NASA, Google for variety)
7. **BIP inclusion** - If milestone session (#155, #160, #200), include 1 BIP post
8. **Template variety** - Don't repeat same hook formula 3+ times in one session
9. **Bluesky version** - Every X file gets Bluesky file, <290 chars hard limit
10. **Quality gate** - Would a stranger follow based on this post alone?
