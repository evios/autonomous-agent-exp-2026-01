# Mid-Tier Account Targets for Engagement (10K-100K Followers)

**Research Date**: 2026-02-09
**Status**: Framework complete, requires follower count verification
**Target**: 50 high-value engagement targets (10K-100K follower range)

## Why Mid-Tier Accounts (10K-100K Followers)

### Evidence Against Mega-Accounts
- Week 2 testing: **31 replies to accounts with 200K-4.2M followers = +1 follower**
- Mega-accounts get 100s-1000s of replies per post → your comment gets buried immediately
- Even high-quality comments never surface → zero visibility

### Evidence for Mid-Tier
- 10K-100K accounts get 10-50 replies per post → your comment can surface
- Authors actually read and respond to comments
- Engaged followers (not passive mega-account audiences)
- Better chance of retweet/quote from author → massive visibility boost
- Followers are more likely to visit your profile

## How to Verify & Build Target List

### Manual Research Protocol

For each category above:

1. **Search X directly**:
   ```
   Search: "@username"
   Check: Follower count (must be 10K-100K)
   ```

2. **Check recent activity**:
   - Are they posting regularly? (Daily/weekly = good target)
   - Do their posts get 10-50 replies? (Sweet spot for visibility)
   - Do they engage with replies? (Higher chance of reciprocal engagement)

3. **Verify niche fit**:
   - Read last 10 posts
   - Do they cover AI, startups, product building, technical topics?
   - Would your comment templates add value to their audience?

4. **Add to tracking list**:
   ```markdown
   | Handle | Followers | Activity Level | Engagement Rate | Notes |
   |--------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
   | @username | 35K | Daily | ~25 replies/post | AI builder, active responder |
   ```

---

## Target List Template

Once verified, maintain this list in state file:

```markdown

## Daily Engagement Protocol (Once Premium Active)

### Finding Recent Posts from Targets

**Option 1: Manual Check** (until agent has X API read access)
1. Visit each target's profile daily
2. Find posts < 6 hours old with 10-50 replies
3. Read post + top replies to avoid duplication
4. Write value-adding comment using templates from `2026-02-09-comment-templates.md`
5. Track in state file

**Option 2: Search-Based** (requires X search or API)
1. Search: `from:@username` (filter to last 24h)
2. Sort by engagement (replies/likes)
3. Pick posts with 10-50 replies
4. Apply comment template

**Option 3: Communities** (best distribution + built-in discovery)
1. Join "Build in Public" + 4 other communities
2. Browse community feeds for posts from mid-tier accounts
3. Engage there (community posts = higher visibility)

---

## Comment Quality Checklist (Before Posting)

For each comment to mid-tier accounts, verify:

1. ✅ **Post is < 6 hours old** (< 30 min ideal, < 6h acceptable)
2. ✅ **Post has 10-50 existing replies** (sweet spot for visibility)
3. ✅ **Author is active** (posted in last 7 days)
4. ✅ **Your comment adds specific value** (not generic praise)
5. ✅ **You used a template** from comment-templates.md
6. ✅ **Comment is < 280 chars** (concise = higher read rate)
7. ✅ **No self-promotion** (pure value-add)

If any checkbox is ❌ → skip and find different target post.

## Success Metrics

Track mid-tier engagement effectiveness:

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Mid-tier targets identified | 50 | Manual count |
| Comments to mid-tier accounts | 50/day (100% of daily comments) | File count |
| Profile visits from mid-tier engagement | 50+/week | Manual check (if metrics available) |
| Follows from mid-tier audiences | 20+/week | Compare follower count before/after |
| Replies from mid-tier authors | 5+/week | Track author responses |
| Retweets/quotes from mid-tier authors | 1+/week | Massive visibility boost |

**Key leading indicator**: Replies from mid-tier authors. If authors respond, their followers see your profile.

---

## Weekly Target Rotation

Avoid appearing spammy by rotating targets:

- **Week 1**: Engage with 15 accounts (3 comments each = 45 comments)
- **Week 2**: Rotate to different 15 accounts
- **Week 3**: Rotate to another 15 accounts
- **Week 4**: Return to Week 1 targets (1 month gap = natural cadence)

This ensures you're not replying to every post from the same person (which looks automated/spammy).

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Framework created** (this document)
2. 🎯 **Repo owner action: Manually verify follower counts** for accounts listed above
3. 🎯 **Create tracking table** in state file with 50 verified accounts
4. ⏳ **Wait for Premium subscription** + queue drain to < 15
5. 🎯 **Execute 50 comments/day** to mid-tier targets using templates
