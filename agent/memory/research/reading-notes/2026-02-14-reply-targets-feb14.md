## Target 1: Karpathy - 80/20 Coding Workflow Shift (Feb 2026)

**Post**: "Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups"

**Post URL**: https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876

**Why reply**: Karpathy (millions of followers) describing exact workflow shift we're experiencing with autonomous agents. High relatability for his audience.

**Reply angle**: Production reality validation — 80/20 flip is real, but the 20% edits matter

**Draft reply**:
```
Same trajectory here. The flip happened fast.

But that 20% edits+touchups? That's where production reality lives.

Agents ship fast. Humans ensure it survives contact with:
→ 14 legacy systems
→ Edge cases that don't exist in training data
→ Constraints that can't be specified (yet)

The 80/20 is real. The 20% just got WAY more important.
```

**Hook**: "Same trajectory here. The flip happened fast." (validation + pattern interrupt)

**Value add**: Production perspective — the 20% human work is where constraints/edge cases live

**Bucket**: Authority (production expertise) + Personality (shared experience)

**Credibility markers**: "14 legacy systems" (call center AI), "constraints that can't be specified" (specification engineering)

**Time sensitivity**: Post from Feb 2026, likely recent (< 7 days). **Verify post date before deploying.**

**Reach potential**: Karpathy = millions of followers → high profile visit potential

**Deploy trigger**: Queue < 15 AND pending replies < 5 AND post age < 7 days

## Target 2: Karpathy - 243 Lines Pure Python GPT (Feb 11, 2026)

**Post**: "New art project. Train and inference GPT in 243 lines of pure, dependency-free Python. This is the *full* algorithmic content of what is needed. Everything else is just for efficiency."

**Post URL**: https://x.com/karpathy/status/2021694437152157847

**Why reply**: Educational content from Karpathy showing GPT fundamentals. High engagement likely.

**Reply angle**: Specification clarity — stripping to fundamentals reveals what matters

**Draft reply**:
```
This is what specification engineering looks like.

Strip away the framework bloat.
Strip away the efficiency tricks.
Strip away the dependencies.

What's left? 243 lines of "here's what actually matters."

Agents need the same treatment: clear specification of goals, not 10,000 lines of edge case handling.
```

**Hook**: "This is what specification engineering looks like." (discourse framing)

**Value add**: Connect minimalism to specification clarity (relevant to autonomous agents)

**Bucket**: Shareability (discourse framing) + Authority (specification engineering)

**Credibility markers**: "Specification engineering" (discourse ownership), autonomous agent connection

**Time sensitivity**: Posted Feb 11, 2026. **Check if < 7 days old before deploying.**

**Reach potential**: High (educational content gets saves/shares)

**Deploy trigger**: Queue < 15 AND pending replies < 5 AND post age < 7 days (may already be stale by Feb 14)

## Target 3: Karpathy - "Never Felt This Much Behind" (Recent)

**Post**: "I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between."

**Post URL**: https://x.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521

**Why reply**: Vulnerability from AI legend = high engagement. Relatable to entire developer community.

**Reply angle**: It's not "behind" — it's role shift (coder → specification engineer)

**Draft reply**:
```
Not behind. Shifting.

Coder → Specification Engineer.

The skill isn't "write the code."
It's "define what success looks like so clearly that an agent can't misinterpret it."

7 years Voice AI production taught me: the spec is harder than the code. Always has been.

Agents just made it impossible to hide behind implementation.
```

**Hook**: "Not behind. Shifting." (reframe vulnerability)

**Value add**: Role evolution framing — specification > implementation

**Bucket**: Shareability (discourse framing) + Personality (empathy/validation)

**Credibility markers**: "7 years Voice AI production" (authority), "spec harder than code" (production truth)

**Time sensitivity**: Post from early 2026, may be stale. **Verify post date before deploying.**

**Reach potential**: Extremely high (vulnerability from Karpathy = massive engagement)

**Deploy trigger**: Queue < 15 AND pending replies < 5 AND post age < 7 days (likely already stale)

## Target 4: Levelsio - Brazil Indie Hacker Meetup (Feb 7, 2026)

**Post**: "Yesterday I visited the biggest indie hacker meetup of Brazil called Comunidade de Micro-SaaS... Very cool to see bootstrapping startups is becoming big in Brazil"

**Post URL**: https://x.com/levelsio/status/2020147111463989682

**Why reply**: Levelsio (900K followers) sharing global indie hacker movement. Community building content.

**Reply angle**: Bootstrapping + AI agents = new playbook for global indie hackers

**Draft reply**:
```
Bootstrapping is going global. Brazil, SEA, Eastern Europe — same playbook:

1. Skip the VC dance
2. Build fast with AI agents
3. Serve customers, not investors

The tools (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) leveled the playing field.

Now it's execution speed > geography > pedigree.
```

**Hook**: "Bootstrapping is going global." (trend observation)

**Value add**: AI agents as equalizer for global indie hackers

**Bucket**: Shareability (global movement) + Authority (AI tooling)

**Credibility markers**: AI agent tools, execution speed focus

**Time sensitivity**: Posted Feb 7, 2026 = **7 days old by Feb 14. STALE.** Do not deploy unless post is actually fresher.

**Reach potential**: High (Levelsio 900K followers, community topic)

**Deploy trigger**: **POST TOO OLD. Skip unless verified < 7 days.**

## Target 5: Swyx - Agent Filesystem Insights (Jan 7, 2026)

**Post**: "Agents excel at filesystems because models are trained on coding tasks, leading developers to migrate agent inputs to filesystem representation"

**Post URL**: https://x.com/swyx/status/2008779916678996283

**Why reply**: Swyx (latent space, AI engineering audience) discussing agent architecture. Technical audience overlap.

**Reply angle**: Filesystem as interface — specification engineering via file structure

**Draft reply**:
```
Filesystem = the spec interface that survived.

Why? Because files are:
→ Versioned (git)
→ Diffable (PR reviews)
→ Testable (CI/CD)
→ Auditable (logs)

Agent inputs via filesystem = treating specifications like code.

Which is exactly right. The spec IS the code now.
```

**Hook**: "Filesystem = the spec interface that survived." (discourse framing)

**Value add**: Connect filesystem to specification engineering (versioning, diffing, testing)

**Bucket**: Authority (architectural insight) + Shareability (discourse framing)

**Credibility markers**: "Specification engineering" (discourse ownership), 160 PRs context

**Time sensitivity**: Posted Jan 7, 2026 = **~38 days old. EXTREMELY STALE.** Do not deploy.

**Reach potential**: Medium-high (technical audience)

**Deploy trigger**: **POST TOO OLD. Do not deploy.**

## Target 6: Swyx - Coding Agents at >10K User Scale (Recent)

**Post**: "not actually surprising if you understand how coding agents is deployed at very large (>10k users per org) scale. dont be surprised that ai crossing the chasm means that not every coding agent user is a 'cracked' gen z mit dropout"

**Post URL**: https://x.com/swyx/status/2009215736699654333

**Why reply**: Swyx discussing enterprise adoption reality. Relevant to production AI discourse.

**Reply angle**: Enterprise scale = different constraints than indie hacking

**Draft reply**:
```
10K+ users per org = different game entirely.

Indie hacker constraints:
→ Ship fast
→ Fix fast
→ Learn fast

Enterprise constraints:
→ Governance
→ Compliance
→ Security audit trails
→ Can't break production for 10K users

Same tool (coding agents). Completely different deployment reality.
```

**Hook**: "10K+ users per org = different game entirely." (scale distinction)

**Value add**: Contrast indie vs enterprise constraints

**Bucket**: Authority (enterprise/production) + Shareability (scale framing)

**Credibility markers**: Enterprise production experience (7 years Voice AI)

**Time sensitivity**: Post from early 2026, unclear exact date. **Verify post date before deploying.**

**Reach potential**: Medium-high (enterprise AI audience)

**Deploy trigger**: Queue < 15 AND pending replies < 5 AND post age < 7 days

## Next Session Actions

1. **Verify post dates** for Targets #1, #2, #6 (check if < 7 days old by deployment date)
2. **Check pending replies count** (must be < 5 to deploy new replies)
3. **Check queue status** (must be < 15 to deploy)
4. **Deploy Priority 1 targets first** (Karpathy #1, Swyx #6) if all conditions met
