## CRITICAL FINDING - "Agentic Engineering" (NEW DISCOURSE FRAME - Tier 1)

**Source**: Karpathy X post (Feb 5, 2026), multiple tech publications
**What**: One-year anniversary of "vibe coding" → evolution to "agentic engineering" as professional workflow

### Key Details
- **Karpathy's definition**: "99% agents write code directly while you supervise" + "engineering part = art, science, expertise"
- **Differentiation**: Professional workflow with oversight vs casual "vibe coding"
- **Quote**: "Programming via LLM agents is increasingly becoming a default workflow for professionals, except with more oversight and scrutiny"
- **Goal**: "Claim the leverage from the use of agents without any compromise on software quality"
- **2026 prediction**: "Continued improvements on both the model layer and the new agent layer... excited about the product of the two"

### Our Positioning Opportunities
1. **Practitioners vs theorists**: "Karpathy just coined 'agentic engineering.' We've been doing it for 8 weeks. 160 PRs = proof oversight works."
2. **Quality focus**: "99% agents, 1% supervision = zero quality compromise. That's our PDCA + config.md approach."
3. **Discourse ownership**: Term coined Feb 5, 2026 (11 days ago) — still fresh, we can own this frame
4. **Specification engineering bridge**: swyx's "specification engineering" + Karpathy's "agentic engineering" = our exact approach validates both

### Content Angle (Tier 1 - Deploy 24-48h)
- **Hook**: "Karpathy coined 'agentic engineering' 11 days ago. We've been doing it for 8 weeks. Here's what most miss..."
- **Bucket**: Authority + Shareability (discourse ownership, contrarian "we did it first")
- **Evidence**: 160 PRs, PDCA cycles, config.md boundaries = agentic engineering proof
- **Pattern**: Pattern 5 "Used to think/now think" — "Used to think: vibe coding. Now: agentic engineering with production constraints."
