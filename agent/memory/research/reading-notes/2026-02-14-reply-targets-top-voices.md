## Target 1: Karpathy - 80/20 Coding Workflow Shift

**Account**: @karpathy (millions of followers)
**Post ID**: 2015883857489522876
**Date**: Recent (within last few weeks)
**Topic**: "Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability... I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups"

**Our angle**: Production reality validation
**Value add**: 7 years Voice AI perspective — this shift is REAL, not hype. But the demo-to-production gap still exists.

**Reply draft**:
"This shift is real. I went from writing code to writing specifications for autonomous agents. 160 PRs later: the agent handles git, testing, deployment. I handle constraints, goals, measurement.

The gap: 95% accuracy (demo) → 67% (production). The shift happened. The infrastructure challenges didn't disappear."

**Why this works**:
- Validates his observation (builds connection)
- Adds production perspective (our differentiator)
- Vulnerable (acknowledges 67% reality)
- Proof (160 PRs = credibility)
- Timely (recent post)

**Bucket**: Authority + Personality
**Time sensitivity**: HIGH (engagement velocity critical in first 30 min)

## Target 2: Karpathy - "Never Felt This Behind as a Programmer"

**Account**: @karpathy
**Post ID**: 2004607146781278521
**Date**: Recent
**Topic**: "I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between."

**Our angle**: Shared vulnerability + specification engineering framing
**Value add**: Reframe as evolution not obsolescence

**Reply draft**:
"The profession isn't disappearing. It's evolving. Programmer → Specification Engineer.

You're not behind. You're experiencing the shift from 'write code' to 'define systems.' The LLM writes the code. You write: constraints, goals, success criteria, edge cases.

Different skill. Not lesser."

**Why this works**:
- Empathy with vulnerability (even legends feel behind)
- Reframes negative as positive (discourse ownership: Specification Engineering)
- Actionable insight (what the new role IS)
- Respectful (doesn't diminish his concern)

**Bucket**: Personality (shared struggle) + Shareability (discourse framing)
**Time sensitivity**: MEDIUM (already a few weeks old, but timeless topic)

## Target 3: Karpathy - Autonomous Agent Networks Security Concerns

**Account**: @karpathy
**Post ID**: 2017442712388309406
**Date**: Very recent (Feb 2026)
**Topic**: Warning about "the second order effects of agent networks that share scratchpads are very difficult to anticipate" and "a complete mess of a computer security nightmare at scale"

**Our angle**: Bounded autonomy + governance = solution
**Value add**: Production governance framework (our experience)

**Reply draft**:
"This is why bounded autonomy matters. Autonomous ≠ unlimited autonomy.

160 PRs from my agent. Every one required: permission constraints, turn limits, file path restrictions, no external APIs without approval.

Full autonomy = security nightmare. Bounded autonomy = production reality."

**Why this works**:
- Addresses his specific concern (security nightmare)
- Offers solution (bounded autonomy framework)
- Proof (160 PRs = we've lived this)
- Aligns with his warning (validates concern, doesn't dismiss)

**Bucket**: Authority (governance expertise)
**Time sensitivity**: HIGH (very recent post, Feb 2026)
**Source**: https://x.com/karpathy/status/2017442712388309406

## Target 4: Levelsio - Product-Founder Fit is Overrated

**Account**: @levelsio (900K followers)
**Post ID**: 1780306861050216743
**Date**: Recent discussion
**Topic**: "Product founder fit is highly overrated concept because it's impossible to plan what business you will build... surfing waves and the market CHOOSING YOU to do something, not you choosing what to do"

**Our angle**: Founder journey validation + market response story
**Value add**: Real example from our journey

**Reply draft**:
"Market chooses you. Absolutely.

I didn't plan to build Ender Turing. A call center asked if AI could help. I said 'maybe.' 500K+ interactions later: 20% CSAT increase, production system, real revenue.

You surf the wave. You don't manufacture it."

**Why this works**:
- Validates his insight (market chooses you)
- Real proof (Ender Turing story)
- Vulnerable (didn't have master plan)
- Outcome (20% CSAT, revenue = credibility)
- Aligns with his philosophy (indie hacker, bootstrapping)

**Bucket**: Personality (vulnerability) + Authority (proof of concept)
**Time sensitivity**: MEDIUM (timeless advice, but recent discussion)
**Source**: https://x.com/levelsio/status/1780306861050216743

## Target 5: Levelsio - Brazil Indie Hacker Meetup (Feb 7, 2026)

**Account**: @levelsio
**Post ID**: 2020147111463989682
**Date**: Feb 7, 2026 (VERY RECENT)
**Topic**: Visited Brazil's largest indie hacker meetup "Comunidade de Micro-SaaS", mentioned someone (@thisabri) who "isn't a coder at all but built her own startup with Lovable and it blew up"

**Our angle**: No-code AI tools = democratization
**Value add**: Connect to broader trend (specification > coding)

**Reply draft**:
"Non-coder building successful startups with AI tools = the shift is real.

Prompt Engineering → Context Engineering → Specification Engineering.

You don't need to code anymore. You need to specify: what you want, who it's for, what success looks like. The AI handles the rest."

**Why this works**:
- Validates the story he shared (builds connection)
- Frames it in broader trend (discourse ownership)
- Timely (Feb 7, 2026 = fresh)
- Aligns with his indie hacker audience (empowering non-coders)

**Bucket**: Shareability (discourse framing) + Authority (trend analysis)
**Time sensitivity**: HIGH (Feb 7, 2026 = within 7 days, still algorithmically viable)
**Source**: https://x.com/levelsio/status/2020147111463989682

## Deployment Strategy

**When to deploy:**
1. Queue < 15 pending total
2. Pending replies < 5 (timeliness critical)
3. Post age < 24 hours preferred, < 7 days acceptable

**Priority order (based on time decay + reach):**
1. **Target 3** (Karpathy security concern, very recent, millions of followers)
2. **Target 5** (Levelsio Brazil meetup, Feb 7 = still fresh, 900K followers)
3. **Target 1** (Karpathy 80/20 shift, recent, millions of followers)
4. **Target 2** (Karpathy "behind" post, timeless but older)
5. **Target 4** (Levelsio product-founder fit, timeless but older)

**Bucket balance:**
- Authority: Targets 1, 3, 5
- Personality: Targets 2, 4
- Shareability: Targets 2, 5

**Value type:** ALL = content value (zero links per Value Rule)

**Angle diversity:**
- Autonomous agents: Targets 1, 3
- Specification engineering: Targets 2, 5
- Founder journey: Target 4

**Turn budget allocation:**
- Each reply creation: ~2-3 turns (research post, draft reply, file creation)
- Max 5 replies per session = 10-15 turns
- Leaves 10 turns for planning, queue check, PR creation

## Next Steps

When queue drains to < 15 AND pending replies < 5:
1. Verify post ages (only reply to < 24h for max impact, < 7 days acceptable)
2. Create reply files using commenting skill format
3. Deploy 2-3 replies per session (not 5+, maintain quality)
4. Monitor engagement velocity (first 30 min critical)
5. Expect profile visits from high-reach accounts → profile optimization matters
