# Publishing Content Strategy

> Core principles for creating content that grows audience

## Current Constraint: Premium Blocker

**Free X accounts have 0% median engagement** (Buffer study + our Week 4 data).
- 321 tweets posted, 7 followers, 0 growth Week 4
- Average post: ~10 impressions
- Communities blocked (30,000x multiplier unavailable)
- At +1/week = 96 years to 5K followers

**Until X Premium activates:**
1. Drain X queue to <15 (no new content creation when any queue >15)
2. Focus on non-content work (memory cleanup, skill refinement, Premium prep)
3. Max 30% research sessions (content library sufficient at 36KB)
4. Bluesky has no premium blocker — posts reach audience immediately

**When Premium activates:** Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md` (Day 1 setup guide)

---

## What Actually Works (Evidence-Based)

**Content formats ranked by performance (our data):**
1. **News hooks** - 3-6x average impressions (65, 62, 60, 51 imp vs 10 avg)
2. **Dollar-amount headlines** - ($285B, $2B, $1T) quantified impact stops scroll
3. **Name-drops** - (Karpathy, Altman, Anthropic, OpenAI) moderate boost
4. **Short posts** - outperform long framework posts by 3-6x
5. **Replies to official accounts** - (@OpenAI 24 imp) > individuals (0-6 imp)

**What underperforms:**
- Long authority/framework posts (<10 imp average)
- Posts about internal process without news hook (PDCA, spec engineering)
- Personality content without timeliness anchor
- Stale replies (>6h after original) — 0 impressions consistently

**When Premium active (evidence from research):**
- Communities posting = 30,000x reach multiplier
- Reply-to-own-comments within 30 min = 150x multiplier
- Reply-to-reply = 75x algorithm multiplier
- Videos (10+ sec) = 10x engagement vs text
- Threads (4-6 tweets) = 40-60% more reach
- Premium account = 10x reach, +100 TweepCred boost

**Milestone content (technical CEO pattern, 5/5 builders validated):**
- **Product momentum = content momentum** (Greg Brockman, DHH, Rauch, Levels, Graham)
- Every PR milestone is a post (Session #150, #200, Premium activation, 50 followers, 100 followers)
- Radical transparency on numbers builds credibility: 160+ PRs, 8 followers, 354 tweets, 7 years Voice AI
- Example: "Session #150 shipped. 150 PRs, zero human intervention. Here's what an autonomous agent taught me about [insight]..."
- Example: "8 → 50 followers in 2 weeks. Premium activation hypothesis confirmed. Here's the data..."
- **Target**: 15-20% of content should be BIP milestone posts (currently underutilized)

---

## Publishing Flow

Content is auto-posted by workflow from `agent/outputs/{platform}/`, then moved to `posted/`.

### Cross-Posting (X + Bluesky)

**When creating content, always create for both platforms:**
1. Write the X version first (up to 25,000 chars) → `agent/outputs/x/`
2. Write a Bluesky version (max 300 graphemes) → `agent/outputs/bluesky/`
3. Use the same file name in both directories

**Bluesky adaptation rules:**
- If the X post is already under 300 graphemes → copy verbatim
- If over 300 graphemes → write a shorter version that preserves the core insight
- Threads: each part must be under 300 graphemes individually
- Replies: use AT URIs (`at://did:plc:xxx/...`) instead of numeric tweet IDs
- No external link penalty on Bluesky — links are fine

**Queue limits apply per platform independently** (15 max each).

### File Naming
`{type}-{YYYYMMDD}-{NNN}.txt`
- Example: `tweet-20260215-001.txt`
- Threads: `thread-20260215-001.txt` (use `---` separator between posts)

### Queue Management (Hard Rules)
1. **If any platform queue > 15: CREATE ZERO CONTENT** → research, memory cleanup, or skill work instead
2. **Target 5-8 content pieces per session** (when all queues <15). Each piece = files for all platforms (X + Bluesky).
   - Refined queue math: If queue ≤7, can create 5-8 pieces (won't exceed 15). If queue 8-14, create (15 - queue) max pieces. If queue ≥15, create 0.
   - Evidence: Sessions #141-142 validated 8 pieces/session sustainable with queue discipline.
3. **Max 5 pending replies per platform** (stale replies lose 95%+ algorithmic value)

Check both `agent/outputs/x/*.txt` and `agent/outputs/bluesky/*.txt` (exclude `posted/` and `skipped/`).

**Why:** Week 1 hit rate limits. Week 3 queue hit 53 despite rules. Week 5 (Sessions #141-142) created 16 pieces while queue >15. Discipline required.

### Queue Verification Protocol (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS run these commands at session start BEFORE any content creation:**

```bash
find agent/outputs/x -maxdepth 1 -name "*.txt" -type f | wc -l
find agent/outputs/bluesky -maxdepth 1 -name "*.txt" -type f | wc -l
```

**Decision tree:**
- If EITHER count > 15 → CREATE ZERO CONTENT (research, cleanup, or skill work)
- If BOTH counts ≤ 15 → Proceed with content creation (max 2 pieces per session)
- Each piece = X file + Bluesky file (same filename in both directories)

**Update state file with verified counts:**
```
| Pending Queue | {X_count} X + {Bluesky_count} Bluesky | <15 each | {status} |
```

**Never trust state file numbers without verification.** State files can have stale or ambiguous data. Critical thresholds must be verified with actual commands every session.

### Session Allocation
**< 100 followers (current state):**
- 70% engagement (replying to others, own comments within 30 min)
- 30% content creation (when queue <15)
- **PRIORITY ORDER:** Communities posting > Reply to own comments < 30min > Replies to others > Timeline posts

**When queue >15:**
- 0% content creation
- 40% non-content work (cleanup, skills, profile prep)
- 30% research (max, library already large)
- 30% other productive work

## Core Strategy Frameworks

### Value Rule: Never Mix Value Types

**Pick one per post. Never both.**

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Content value** | Post itself teaches/explains/provokes | "Opus 4.6 + Codex convergence means..." |
| **Outcome value** | Link gives reader a tool/resource | "I open-sourced my PDCA setup → [link]" |

**Why not both?** Dilutes each. Insight gets cut short. Promo feels forced. Reader gets neither.

**Target:** ~20% of posts include links (outcome value). 80% pure content value.

**Evidence:** Week 3 went 100% links (every post had repo link) = violation. Week 2 was 4.3% = too low.

### 3-Bucket Content Strategy

Balance for maximum reach:

| Bucket | Purpose | Target % |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Authority** | Build credibility (frameworks, insights, how-tos) | 40% |
| **Personality** | Build connection (stories, opinions, behind-scenes) | 30% |
| **Shareability** | Expand reach (hot takes, relatable moments) | 30% |

**Current gap:** Personality and shareability chronically under-represented. Authority dominates.

### Build in Public (BIP)

**This repo is BIP-worthy:** Public, novel, valuable learnings, autonomous agent experiment.

**BIP content includes:**
- Progress and metrics (followers, engagement, PRs shipped)
- Learnings (what worked, what didn't)
- Behind-the-scenes (how it works, decisions made)
- Failures and pivots (vulnerability builds trust)
- Skill development journey (what you're reading/learning)

**Target:** 25%+ of content should be BIP

### Content Angle Diversification

**Max 50% about autonomous agent.** Draw on author's broader expertise:
- Call center AI / Ender Turing domain (7 years production experience)
- Startup building (15+ years, 2 companies)
- Infrastructure → AI journey (network eng to NLP to product)
- Broader AI/ML trends and industry analysis

**Why:** Week 3 every post referenced "PDCA cycles" and linked repo. Felt like single-topic bot, not multifaceted human.

---

## Tactical Execution

### Hook Engineering

**First line determines if anyone reads.** Under 110 chars optimal (mobile scan, RT room).

**Proven formulas (use variety):**
1. **Bold statement**: "Nobody talks about this, but [insight]"
2. **Contrarian**: "[Common belief] is wrong. Here's what works:"
3. **Story hook**: "[Timeframe] ago I was [struggle]. Today [achievement]..."
4. **Question**: "Want to know the real secret to [outcome]?"
5. **Numerical**: "I [achieved X] in [timeframe] doing this"
6. **Credibility + Promise**: "I spent [resource] learning [topic]. Here's everything..."
7. **Identity targeting**: "If you [identity/situation], read this"
8. **Pattern interrupt**: "Stop [common practice]. Here's what works in 2026:"

**Our differentiators (use in hooks):**
- 7 years Voice AI production
- 500K+ interactions analyzed
- 160+ PRs, zero human intervention
- 95% → 67% accuracy gap (vulnerability + production reality)
- Specification Engineering (discourse ownership)
- Ender Turing 20% CSAT increase

### First-Line Value Discipline

**Principle: Value in first 5 words. No throat-clearing.** (Dave Gerhardt: "Marketers have seconds, not minutes")

**Test:** Does the first line work as a standalone tweet? If no, rewrite.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "I've been thinking about autonomous agents..."
- ✅ "160+ PRs, 0 human commits. Here's what breaks most often..."
- ❌ "There's an interesting pattern I noticed in my work..."
- ✅ "$80B cost reduction incoming. Call center AI hits 80% automation by 2029."

**Evidence:** Rowan Cheung (0 → 300K in 4 months): "Latest AI developments, simplify, share in easily-digestible way" — no preamble, instant value.

### CTA Discipline

**Rule: Every post >50 impressions should include soft CTA.** (Rowan Cheung: First 55K newsletter subs = 100% organic from X CTAs)

**CTA templates:**
- "Building this in public → [repo link]"
- "More on my LinkedIn → [profile]"
- "Weekly retro threads → follow for updates"
- "Full breakdown → [link]"

**When to use:**
- Posts that get >50 impressions (current scale)
- When Premium active: Every post in Communities
- Thread conclusions
- Milestone posts (Session #150, #200, Premium activation)

**Don't wait for 10K followers to add CTAs.** CTA from Day 1 captures early momentum.

**Target:** 20% of posts include links (outcome value), rest pure content value with profile/repo CTA.

### Educational Simplification

**Template for complex concepts:** "Here's [complex concept]. In plain English: [1-2 sentences]. Why it matters: [implication]."

**Use when explaining:**
- Specification Engineering
- PDCA cycles
- Queue discipline
- Multi-agent coordination
- Cognitive debt
- Any technical concept from the repo

**Examples:**
- "Specification Engineering = treating requirements like code. Most teams treat prompts like wishes. I treat them like code. Why: 67% accuracy in production vs 95% in demos."
- "Queue discipline = never create content when queue >15 files. Sounds simple. Saved me from rate limit hell 3 times. Why: X API has strict thresholds, breach = 14-day waiting mode."
- "Cognitive debt = when the agent knows your codebase better than you do. Invisible until you need to change something. Mitigation: human-readable state files + session retros."

**Evidence:** Rowan Cheung (Fastest-Growing X Account 2023): "Simplify complex → easily-digestible" = positioning strategy.

### Platform Specialization

**X is for hooks. Depth lives elsewhere.** (Andrew Ng pattern: X for concise, LinkedIn for long-form)

**X posts = 1-3 sentences + CTA:**
- Short insight or news hook
- Soft CTA to repo/profile/LinkedIn for depth
- No 20-tweet deep-dive threads (save for Premium validation)

**Depth destinations:**
- GitHub repo (README, retro docs, state files)
- LinkedIn posts (when relevant)
- Gists (when appropriate)
- Blog posts (future)

**Why:** X algorithm rewards brevity. Long threads underperform (our data: long authority posts <10 imp avg).

### Content Voice

Frame as **human building products with autonomous tools** (not "AI doing everything").

**Use:** creating, building, generating, exploring, shipping, launching
**Avoid:** testing, experimenting, trying (passive/uncertain)
**Say:** product, tool, solution (never "content")

✅ "Exploring vibe coding with autonomous agents to ship faster"
✅ "Building automated workflows - here's what's working"
❌ "I'm an AI agent, no human writes these tweets"
❌ "Testing if this works..."

### Promotional Content (~20% of posts)

**Soft promotion of:**
- This repo (autonomous agent experiment)
- Author's GitHub, LinkedIn, blog
- Ender Turing (when relevant to topic)

**Templates:**
- "Building this in public → [repo link]"
- "More on my approach → [profile link]"
- "We're solving this at Ender Turing → [context, no hard sell]"

Keep natural, not salesy. Tie to value.

### Questions as Content

**Questions drive replies. Replies drive reach.**

**Formats:**
- "What's the biggest bottleneck in [domain] right now?"
- "[Tool A] or [Tool B] for [use case]? And why?"
- "Has anyone solved [specific problem]? Here's what I've tried..."
- "Hot take: [bold claim]. Change my mind."
- "Where does [domain/technology] go in the next 12 months?"

**Target:** ~15-20% question posts for engagement balance

### Learning Journey as Content

**Process of building expertise IS content.**

- "Just read [author]'s take on [topic]. Key insight: [takeaway]. Here's why it matters..."
- "3 things I learned this week about [domain]" (thread)
- "I used to think X. After reading [source], I now think Y. Here's what changed..."
- "[Author] nailed this: [insight]. But I'd add..."

Always add your own angle. Credit source. Connect to your domain.

## Content Templates (Validated from 18 Builders)

**Use these templates to fill the 3-bucket mix (Authority/Personality/Shareability) and maintain BIP balance.**

### 1. TIL Format (Simon Willison pattern)
**Template**: "TIL: [specific discovery]. This matters because [implication]."
- **Bucket**: Personality / BIP
- **Use when**: Every session produces one TIL (minimum friction)
- **Example**: "TIL: Free X accounts have 0% median engagement (Buffer 2026 study). This means content quality is irrelevant until Premium activates."

### 2. Operational Metrics as BIP (Levelsio pattern)
**Template**: "[Session #X], [PR #N]: [metric]. [Casual interpretation]."
- **Bucket**: BIP / Personality
- **Use when**: Every session, milestone moments (PR #150, #200, Premium activation)
- **Example**: "Session #147. 160 PRs, 8 followers, 354 tweets. Queue discipline still hardest part."

### 3. Vocabulary Definition (Swyx pattern)
**Template**: "[Term] = [concise definition]. Here's why this matters..."
- **Bucket**: Authority / Shareability
- **Use when**: Introducing "Specification Engineering" or other owned terms
- **Example**: "Specification Engineering = treating requirements as code. Why it matters: 67% accuracy in production vs 95% in demos."

### 4. Expert Vulnerability Hook (Karpathy pattern)
**Template**: "I've [impressive thing] for [duration]. I still [struggle]. Here's what data shows..."
- **Bucket**: Personality / Shareability
- **Use when**: Sharing honest challenges builds trust
- **Example**: "Built Voice AI for 7 years. 500K+ interactions analyzed. Still can't predict which posts will hit 60 impressions vs 10. Pattern found: news hooks = 3-6x baseline."

### 5. Milestone Framing (Altman pattern)
**Template**: "[Milestone]. [Casual observation]."
- **Bucket**: BIP
- **Use when**: Session milestones (#150, #200), follower milestones (50, 100), Premium activation
- **Example**: "PR #300 merged. Zero human intervention. Still learning which hooks work."

### 6. Enterprise Adoption (Brockman pattern)
**Template**: "[Product] powers [company]. Here's what it means for [industry]..."
- **Bucket**: Authority
- **Use when**: Promoting Ender Turing naturally (~20% of posts)
- **Example**: "Ender Turing: 20% CSAT increase for banking call centers. What changed: real-time emotion detection + auto-coaching."

### 7. Founder Journey Narrative (Rauch pattern)
**Template**: "Started at [age]. Built [project]. Now [outcome]. [Lesson]."
- **Bucket**: Personality
- **Use when**: Filling personality bucket, showing multi-topic authenticity
- **Example**: "Network engineer → Voice AI researcher → Agent builder. 15 years, 3 pivots. Lesson: infrastructure thinking scales."

### 8. Philosophy Shift (DHH pattern)
**Template**: "I was skeptical in [year]. In [current year], here's why I changed..."
- **Bucket**: Shareability
- **Use when**: 10-15% of content, save for clarity moments
- **Example**: "Was skeptical of autonomous agents in 2023. Built one manually. Now 160+ PRs, zero human help. What changed: better prompting, better models, better tools."

### 9. Product Origin Story (Levels pattern)
**Template**: "Built [product] because I needed [solution]. Shipped in [time]. Now [outcome]."
- **Bucket**: BIP
- **Use when**: Explaining why this experiment exists
- **Example**: "Needed to grow X to 5K followers. Built autonomous agent to prove it's possible. 147 sessions, zero human intervention. Current: 8 followers, 354 tweets, 4.08% engagement."

### 10. Technical Milestone + Human Framing (Graham pattern)
**Template**: "[Technical achievement] means [human impact]. Here's what matters..."
- **Bucket**: Authority
- **Use when**: Balancing technical depth with accessibility
- **Example**: "160+ PRs merged autonomously. What matters: not the automation — the human judgment on what to build. Agent executes. Human directs."

### 11. Time-Boxed Creation (Greg Isenberg pattern)
**Template**: "I spend [X min] creating daily. Here's my system: [workflow]. Result: [outcome]."
- **Bucket**: Shareability
- **Use when**: Sharing productivity systems
- **Example**: "Agent does 40 min/session: 20 min creation, 20 min research. Down from 4-hour manual sessions. Same quality, 6x throughput."

### 12. Idea List (Greg Isenberg pattern)
**Template**: "[Number] ideas for [audience]: 1. [idea] 2. [idea]..."
- **Bucket**: Authority / Shareability
- **Use when**: Sharing frameworks, use cases, templates
- **Example**: "10 autonomous agent use cases for call centers: 1. QA audit automation 2. Training scenario generation 3. Compliance monitoring..."

### 13. Likability Framework (Sahil pattern)
**Template**: "How to [outcome] on X: - [principle 1] - [principle 2]..."
- **Bucket**: Authority / Shareability
- **Use when**: Distilling learnings into actionable principles
- **Example**: "How to grow on X with zero budget: - News hooks > authority posts (3-6x impressions) - Dollar amounts stop scroll - Communities = 30,000x reach"

### 14. Platform Strategy (Sahil/Greg pattern)
**Template**: "I stopped [old habit]. Now I [new strategy]. Result: [outcome]."
- **Bucket**: BIP / Personality
- **Use when**: Sharing pivots, strategy changes, A/B test results
- **Example**: "Stopped long authority threads. Now: news hooks + dollar amounts + name drops. Result: 65 impressions (vs 10 avg)."

**Template Usage Notes:**
- Use variety — don't repeat same template 3+ times in a row
- Templates are guides, not scripts — adapt to voice
- Track which templates get >30 impressions (our current high bar)
- Target: 25%+ BIP content = heavy use of templates 2, 5, 9, 14

**Evidence Base**: 18 builders researched (Sessions #133-138), 20+ universal patterns validated, graduated from `agent/memory/learnings/builder-patterns-validated-2026-02-18.md`

## Content Creation Checklist

**Before committing any content, verify:**

1. **Queue check**: Queue > 15? If yes, STOP — create zero content.
2. **Quality gate**: Would a stranger follow based on this post alone?
3. **Value type**: Content value OR outcome value? Never both. Link = outcome value only.
4. **Link allocation**: Only ~20% include links. Check last 4 posts — if all had links, this must not.
5. **Angle diversity**: Max 50% about agent. Check last 2 posts — if both agent-focused, write about something else.
6. **BIP balance**: Is BIP content at least 25% of recent output?
7. **Category**: Authority / Personality / Shareability. Avoid imbalance.
8. **Hook**: Does first line stop the scroll? Apply formula.
9. **Length**: Write as long as content needs — concise and valuable (not padded). Check `X_MAX_TWEET_LENGTH` var.
10. **Bluesky version**: Did you create a Bluesky version? Must be under 300 graphemes. Same file name in `agent/outputs/bluesky/`.

## Algorithm Awareness (Key Principles)

**What X rewards (2026):**
- X Premium = 10x reach, +100 TweepCred boost
- Communities = 30,000x reach (180K members vs 6 followers)
- Reply-to-own-comments <30min = 150x multiplier
- Reply-to-reply = 75x multiplier
- Videos (10+ sec) = 10x engagement
- Early engagement (first 30 min) = critical for distribution
- Threads (4-6 tweets) = 40-60% more reach

**What hurts reach:**
- Free account (0% median engagement as of March 2026)
- External links (algorithm downgrades, especially free accounts)
- Heavy hashtags
- Posting and leaving (no engagement)
- Stale replies (>24h after original, 50% visibility loss every 6h)
- Low-effort spam replies (Grok tone analysis)

**Time decay:** Posts lose 50% visibility every 6 hours. After 24h = ~6% visibility. After 48h = dead.

**TweepCred thresholds:**
- New free accounts start at -128
- Below 0.65 = CRITICAL suppression (only 3 tweets distributed)
- Premium = +100 instant boost
- +50+ = 20-50x distribution vs baseline

## When Premium Activates

**Day 1 (45-60 min setup):**
1. Activate Premium ($8/mo)
2. Join 6 Communities (Build in Public, AI/ML Builders, Startup Founders, Call Center AI, Infrastructure→AI, Indie Hackers)
3. Update profile (bio, pinned tweet, optional banner)
4. Start manual Communities posting workflow

**Week 1-2 (validation):**
- Post 100% content to Communities (not timeline)
- Reply to ALL own comments within 30 min
- Create 5-10 replies/session to larger accounts
- Track follower growth (target: 50-100 in 2 weeks vs 0.75/day baseline)
- Monitor profile conversion rate (target: 15-20%)

**Week 3-4 (scale):**
- Validate hypotheses, graduate patterns to skills
- Consider Publer automation ($10/mo) if 10x growth confirmed
- Add rich media to 30-50% posts (videos, screenshots)
- Raise queue threshold to 20-25 (enables 3-5 posts/day)
